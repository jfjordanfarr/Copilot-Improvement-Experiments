## Capabilities

### CAP-001 – Layer‑4 Backbone
Deliver a repository-embedded corpus of Live Documentation where every tracked asset owns an authored preamble and generated sections (`Public Symbols`, `Dependencies`, archetype metadata) stored in a mirror tree under `/.mdmd/layer-4/` (path configurable per workspace). Layer‑4 docs are the only durable artefacts the project promises to maintain; everything else must be derivable from this base ([AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/2025-11-08.md](../../AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/2025-11-08.md)).
Drive parity across the languages we benchmark today by teaching the generator to emit the same sections for repository-hosted Python, C#, Java, Ruby, Rust, and C fixtures before onboarding external codebases, keeping “Layer‑4 everywhere” a falsifiable promise.

### CAP-002 – Analysis Bridges
Automate symbol extraction, docstring reconciliation, dependency inference, and evidence harvesting so generated sections stay current and lintable. Normalise documentation across languages by projecting XML/TSDoc/Sphinx/Rustdoc tags into a canonical schema (`summary`, `remarks`, `parameters`, `typeParameters`, `returns`, `exceptions`, `examples`, `links`) rendered as deterministic `##### `Symbol` — Field` subsections. Preserve unmapped fragments with provenance so adapters can round-trip raw payloads while Live Docs stay structured. The analysis stack powers regeneration, emits provenance, and exposes confidence so downstream consumers can trust on-demand views ([specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md](../../specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md)).

### CAP-003 – On-Demand System Views
Expose ephemeral system-level materialized views—clustered components, workflows, coverage rollups—through CLI commands, diagnostics, and APIs. These views are regenerated when requested and never treated as long-lived documents, allowing us to mix rigorous statistics, local history, and scenario-specific filters without risking doc rot ([AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/10/2025-10-29.md](../../AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/10/2025-10-29.md)). The flagship CLI experience traces dependency paths between arbitrary “from” and “to” artifacts (or walks to terminal roots when only one endpoint is provided) so impact analysis becomes a single command instead of a scavenger hunt across docs.

### CAP-004 – Governance & Memory
Keep stakeholder directives, MIT licensing posture, and competitive research (Windsurf Codemaps, GitLab Knowledge Graph) codified alongside the Live Doc tooling while enforcing guardrails (SlopCop, safe-commit, waiver taxonomies) that make the whole system auditable ([AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/user-intent-census.md](../../AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/user-intent-census.md)).

### CAP-005 – Layer Distribution Surfaces
Publish vision + roadmap knowledge to a static site (initially GitHub Pages), delegate requirement execution traceability to Spec-Kit and issue trackers, and keep System intelligence as CLI-driven materialized views. This capability ensures each MDMD layer lives where it provides the most value while the Layer‑4 corpus remains the canonical source of truth for generated analytics ([AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/live-documentation-doc-refactor-plan.md](../../AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/live-documentation-doc-refactor-plan.md)).

### CAP-006 – Generative Authoring & Docstring Bridges
Deliver a two-way authoring loop where Live Docs act as the editable AST for code and documentation. Writers can draft or revise summaries, remarks, and parameter notes inside Layer‑4 markdown and push those changes back into inline docstrings; conversely, analyzers harvest rich docstring payloads (including HTML blocks, custom tags, and examples) into canonical Live Doc sections. Feature flags protect legacy flows while we graduate round-trip sync, generative skeleton scaffolding, and language-specific adapters that can emit starter code or pseudocode from authored Live Doc intent ([AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/2025-11-13.md](../../AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/2025-11-13.md)).

### CAP-007 – Hosted Showcase & Trials
Deliver a stateless, Cloudflare-hosted showcase that clones public GitHub repositories, runs the existing Live Docs generator headlessly, and returns a downloadable bundle (markdown mirror, provenance metadata, replay instructions) so prospects can evaluate the system without installing the extension. The hosted surface is marketing-only: it never replaces the offline-first workflow, always links back to the local VS Code extension, and must highlight compatibility with VS Code forks like Windsurf and Cursor to reinforce multi-IDE reach. Instrument the flow with telemetry that proves workspaces are deleted immediately while preserving enough audit trails to troubleshoot demo failures ([AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/2025-11-15.md](../../AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/2025-11-15.md)).

### CAP-008 – Live Visualization Command Center
Deliver a unified `npm run live-docs:visualize` surface that merges the “circuit board” workspace view, the local symbol explorer, and the force-directed graph into a single command center grounded in Layer‑4 Live Docs. Maintainers should pan across file-level clusters, hover or click to expand a file into its public symbols, and optionally hide unrelated nodes to focus on inbound/outbound relationships. The detail panel must surface the relevant Live Doc metadata, provide “open in editor” affordances, and set the stage for future text editing so authors can scaffold code or docstrings bidirectionally. This primary view is expected to meet WCAG AA accessibility (keyboard navigation, high-contrast palettes, screen-reader announcements), while the force-directed explorer may prioritise spatial discovery over full accessibility. Requirements are captured across the 2025-11-20 Antigravity UX sessions ([AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/Antigravity/11-20/83f976da-d7f4-4c75-a16d-561dfbea1a4b/Refining UI Interactions.md](../../AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/Antigravity/11-20/83f976da-d7f4-4c75-a16d-561dfbea1a4b/Refining%20UI%20Interactions.md)).

## Desired Outcomes
- Layer‑4 Live Docs regenerate deterministically; authored content stays small, intentional, and easy to review.
- Implementation Live Docs list their public surface, structured docstring fields, dependencies, and observed evidence so ripple impact and test coverage are auditable in markdown alone.
- Test and asset archetypes expose their relationships through generated sections (`Targets`, `Supporting Fixtures`, `Consumers`), enabling cross-language AST traversal without bespoke parsers.
- Ephemeral System views spin up from the Layer‑4 corpus on demand (markdown, JSON, graph exports) and can safely incorporate statistical analytics or local history without committing churn to the repo.
- Layer‑1 capabilities replicate cleanly into a static site (GitHub Pages or equivalent) so stakeholders consume the same markdown we curate in-repo.
- Hosted showcase runs reuse the exact generator stack, emit reproducible bundles, and always point participants back to local regeneration so offline workflows remain the authoritative path.
- Layer‑2 requirement docs cross-link to Spec-Kit tasks or issue trackers while remaining the authoritative summaries for automation.
- Diagnostics, exports, and LLM prompts rely on the same markdown-as-AST graph, shrinking the gap between human review workflows and autonomous copilots.
- The Live Docs visualization command center unifies global file exploration with local symbol drilldowns, supports focus-mode filtering, and provides an accessible path toward inline editing and docstring scaffolding.
- Markdown links stay relative (slug dialect configurable) so Live Docs double as wiki-friendly artefacts consumers can publish directly.
- Tooling, instructions, and licensing remain MIT-friendly so adopters can regenerate Layer‑4 docs locally and opt into System analytics when needed.
- Structured docstring subsections provide anchored headers per field so diagnostics, prompts, and writers can target summaries, parameters, remarks, or examples without scraping prose.
- Two-way docstring bridges allow Live Docs to seed inline documentation and future generative workflows without forking the source of truth.
- Multi-IDE distribution (VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor, and future forks) stays first-class by ensuring commands, docs, and hosted showcases all document their compatibility and offline fallback steps.

## Success Signals
- ≥95% of modified source files have Live Docs regenerated within the same verify run, and all generated sections hash-match local analyser output (SC-LD-001).
- No Live Doc ships without observed evidence or an approved waiver, cutting undocumented implementations by 80% during pilot audits (SC-LD-002).
- On-demand System exports flag architectural hotspots (coverage gaps, cluster outliers) in ≤2 s for repositories under 10k files without writing permanent files (SC-LD-003).
- External adopters can enable the Live Documentation extension, regenerate Layer‑4 docs, and run System analytics locally thanks to MIT licensing and deterministic pipelines (SC-LD-004).
- Structured docstring bridges surface multi-tag payloads (summary, remarks, parameters, returns, exceptions) in ≥95% of regenerated Live Docs for supported languages, with unmapped tags logged for follow-up (SC-LD-005).
- Bidirectional docstring sync ships behind a feature flag, records round-trip success for ≥90% of supported language fixtures, and never mutates authored sections without human opt-in (SC-LD-006).
- The visualization command center meets WCAG AA contrast and keyboard-navigation checks, resolves focus-mode filtering within two interactions, and launches local-symbol detail panels in ≤500 ms for repos under 5k files (SC-LD-007).

## Evidence
- US1–US5 integration suites validate ripple diagnostics for code, documentation, acknowledgement, scope collision, and transforms ([tests/integration](/tests/integration)).
- Graph snapshot and audit CLIs keep deterministic caches and coverage guarantees ([scripts/graph-tools](/scripts/graph-tools)).
- SlopCop markdown lint runs inside the safe-to-commit gate, blocking hallucinated links before commit ([scripts/slopcop/check-markdown-links.ts](/scripts/slopcop/check-markdown-links.ts)).
- Layer 3 and 4 MDMD catalogues—soon to become Live Docs themselves—document runtime, ingestion, and diagnostics flows that feed CAP-001 through CAP-003.

## Target Personas
- **Implementers**: engineers expect Live Docs to show programmatic surface, dependents, and tests before accepting Copilot suggestions or merging a PR.
- **Test Authors**: quality engineers rely on test Live Docs to declare coverage scope and fixture responsibilities without spelunking large suites.
- **Writers and Architects**: documentation owners edit a concise authored block while trusting generated sections to reflect the latest code reality.
- **Leads and Reviewers**: reviewers pull Live Docs and CLI summaries to gauge blast radius and evidence before approving changes.

## Guiding Principles
1. **Markdown as AST** – treat Layer‑4 markdown links, headings, and sections as the canonical graph; analyzers refresh markdown, not bespoke caches.
2. **Workspace Local First** – run entirely on developer machines, keeping data private and reproducible; remote feeds remain optional accelerators and hosted showcases are explicitly positioned as marketing trials that always link back to local workflows (VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor, and other forks).
3. **Generated Blocks are Sacred** – tooling owns generated sections; humans curate authored notes and waivers with discipline.
4. **Evidence or Escalation** – every implementation must link to proof, or record a waiver explaining the gap.
5. **Shareable by Default** – Live Docs, CLI exports, hosted showcase bundles, and MIT licensing keep artefacts portable across GitHub, Azure DevOps, and other wiki surfaces.
6. **System Views are Materialized** – architecture/topology views are regenerated when needed and never treated as permanent docs, freeing analytics to evolve without churn.
7. **Continuous Falsifiability** – benchmarks, integration suites, and SlopCop rules back every guarantee with repeatable tests.
8. **Authoring Loops Stay Human-First** – bidirectional sync and generative scaffolds require explicit human confirmation and publish audit trails so Live Docs never silently rewrite code or docstrings.
9. **Accessibility Guides Trust** – visualization surfaces prioritise keyboard access, focus management, and contrast so Live Docs remain inclusive even as discovery-focused views (force graph) experiment with richer spatial affordances.

## Scope and Non Goals
- **In scope**: Live Documentation VS Code extension, language server pipelines, markdown graph builder, docstring bridges, diagnostics and CLI exports, MIT license preparation.
- **Out of scope (current spec)**: IDE-agnostic clients, automated remediation, CI enforcement beyond safe-commit, hosted SaaS offerings, non-configurable storage locations.

## Evolution Path
- **Live Doc Baseline (present)**: converge MDMD Layer‑4 docs onto authored/generated structure and stage generator output in `/.live-documentation/`.
- **Docstring & Evidence Bridges (near term)**: wire analyzers and coverage tools so generated sections stay accurate across languages and test suites. Canonicalise docstring tags into the shared schema, emit deterministic per-field subheadings, validate against curated polyglot fixtures, and surface drift diagnostics when inline documentation diverges from Live Doc narratives.
- **Bidirectional Authoring (mid term)**: land docstring round-trip tooling, capture provenance for pushes from Live Docs into code, and graduate feature flags that let Live Docs seed pseudocode or skeleton implementations across languages.
- **Consumption Surfaces (near term)**: deliver CLI, diagnostics, and LLM exports backed by the Live Doc graph.
- **Layer Distribution (mid term)**: stand up the public site pipeline, formalise Spec-Kit/issue tracker delegation for Layer 2, and ship the on-demand System CLI so no architecture docs linger in the repo.
- **Metadata Enrichers (mid term)**: add churn metrics, reference counts, and change history as optional generated sections; experiment with higher-layer docs (releases, work items, architecture) generated from Layer‑4 facts.
- **Ecosystem Expansion (long term)**: share MIT-licensed tooling, integrate alternative knowledge feeds, and explore IDE-agnostic adapters.

## Adoption Path
- **Stage 0 – Observe**: bootstrap Live Docs from existing MDMD content, allow read-only exploration, and collect feedback.
- **Stage 1 – Guard**: enable lint warnings for missing evidence or stale generated sections; provide regeneration commands in safe-commit.
- **Stage 2 – Bridge**: enforce docstring and coverage sync, introduce CLI/LLM exports, and activate diagnostics sourced from Live Docs.
- **Stage 3 – Sustain**: require green Live Doc gates before merge; external adopters configure storage and regen workflows mirroring ours.
- **Stage 4 – Distribute**: publish Layer 1 to the public site, keep Layer 2 synced with Spec-Kit/issue trackers, and rely on CLI materialized views for System intelligence.

## Open Questions
- What UX affordances best expose ripple metadata without overwhelming users? (Tracked in T042 roadmap.)
- How should we prioritise future feed integrations such as LSIF, SCIP, or GitLab knowledge graphs under the offline-first stance?
- What rollout messaging best guides adopters through the public-site pipeline and Layer 2 integration handoff?
- When Copilot suggests a change, how do we feed Live Doc awareness back into the suggestion pipeline without impacting latency?
- What is the minimal metadata set required for binary assets so generated sections stay useful without bloating the repo?

## Implementation Touchpoints
- [Live Documentation Generator](../layer-3/language-server-architecture.mdmd.md) will orchestrate analyzers, docstring bridges, and markdown emitters to refresh generated sections.
- [Knowledge Feed Manager](../../.mdmd/layer-4/packages/server/src/features/knowledge/knowledgeFeedManager.ts.mdmd.md) keeps optional LSIF/SCIP feeds healthy so generated sections remain accurate.
- [Diagnostics Tree View](../../.mdmd/layer-4/packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts.mdmd.md) and [Export Diagnostics Command](../../.mdmd/layer-4/packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts.mdmd.md) consume Live Docs for impact analysis.
- [SlopCop Markdown Audit](../../.mdmd/layer-4/scripts/slopcop/check-markdown-links.ts.mdmd.md) and future Live Doc-specific lint rules enforce authored/generated boundaries and evidence guarantees.

## Code Anchors
- [`packages/server/src/main.ts`](../../packages/server/src/main.ts) bootstraps the language server runtime that triggers Live Doc regeneration.
- [`packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts`](../../packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts) coordinates analyzers that populate generated sections.
- [`packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishCodeDiagnostics.ts`](../../packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishCodeDiagnostics.ts) and [`publishDocDiagnostics.ts`](../../packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.ts) will source messages from the Live Doc graph to uphold the “definitive answer” promise.
