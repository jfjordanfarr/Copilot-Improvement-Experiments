# Clean Dist Utility (Layer 4)

## Source Mapping
- Implementation: [`tests/integration/clean-dist.mjs`](../../../../tests/integration/clean-dist.mjs)
- Collaborators: [`packages/extension/package.json`](../../../../packages/extension/package.json), [`packages/server/package.json`](../../../../packages/server/package.json) (for `npm run build` outputs)

## Responsibility
Remove stale `dist/` directories for the extension and server packages before integration suites execute. Ensures tests run against freshly compiled artifacts and prevents file residue from influencing scenario expectations.

## Workflow
1. Resolve the repository root relative to the script location.
2. Identify `packages/extension/dist` and `packages/server/dist` (plus additional subdirectories when present).
3. Delete the directories recursively using Nodeâ€™s filesystem APIs, ignoring missing paths to keep the script idempotent.
4. Emit console logs summarising deletions so test logs show which artifacts were cleared.

## Usage
- Invoked implicitly by `npm run test:integration` prior to spawning the VS Code harness.
- Can be executed manually to prepare a clean slate when debugging integration failures locally.

## Follow-ups
- Extend coverage to generated SQLite caches if future suites require a clean knowledge graph.
- Add an environment flag to skip deletion for faster iterative runs when developers knowingly changed only test code.
