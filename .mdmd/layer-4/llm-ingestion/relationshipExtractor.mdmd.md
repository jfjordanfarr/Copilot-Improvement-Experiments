jfjordanfarr: jfjordanfarr: jfjordanfarr: Today is 10/24/2025. It is now dev day 8! Please summarize the previous dev day into an auditable, turn-by-turn conversation summary in the same style as the other dev day summaries. 

**PLEASE READ ALL PRIOR SUMMARIES IN FULL BEFORE SUMMARIZING YESTERDAY'S CONVERSATION**

Yesterday's dev conversation: #file:2025-10-23.md 
Summary folder: #file:Summarized 

Once we've completed that, we can reground on the specs and docs and determine what our next concrete development tasks/steps are.

**Daily Recap**  
- Implemented symbol-neighbor traversal end to end: symbolNeighbors.ts, symbols.ts, and VS Code command in inspectSymbolNeighbors.ts.  
- Hardened graph persistence by canonicalising artifacts/links and fixing change-event writes (graphStore.ts, saveDocumentChange.ts, related tests).  
- Added Quick Pick test hooks plus integration coverage in testHooks.ts and inspectSymbolNeighbors.test.ts, eliminating the UI hang.  
- Updated docs/tasks to mark US4 work complete (tasks.md) and captured the development log in 2025-10-23.md.  
- Full pipeline now green: `npm run verify` (lint → unit → integration) succeeded after the fixes.

**Next Steps**  
1. Pick up T067 (CLI instrumentation + workflow doc) to extend maintainer tooling.

jfjordanfarr: You were very close! I see that your context window filled up around line 6000 of reading yesterday's dev conversation. Since you were already hydrated with the prior summaries before the context-crunching autosummarization step went off, it should be okay if you simply perform the turn-by-turn summarization of yesterday's conversation without rehydrating on those first. You now have, in aggregate, the general overall historical trajectory of development. You should have juuuuuuuuust enough context to pull off summarizing yesterday's conversation, but if you want to play it safe, I'd maybe crunch 2000 lines at a time, summarizing all the exchanges that occurred during that chunk. (Noting that we still want our conversation summaries to have turn-by-turn fidelity and associations to the commits created during that dev day -- yesterday's commits bleed into today, 10/24).

Summarized conversation history

jfjordanfarr: Oof. Okay, here's what we can do. Let's get turn-by-turn summaries **Created** for **1000** lines at a time **before ingesting the next thousand lines**. This should hopefully allow us to strike our proverbial mental pitons into the rock wall of this problem, climbing up even as the winds of autosummarization try to knock us back down. You've got this. You've shown a lot of cleverness in the past regarding your own limitations. Yesterday's conversation "Copy All" artifact doesn't expose this bit of richness, but I actually saw you pop off an integration test, knowing that your LLM tools would falsely report it as completed to you, after which you then proceeded to mointor the same terminal over and over, doing a tiny bit of "thinking" as an action **as a means to occupy time to let the test run**. I have never ever in my life seen an LLM pick up anything remotely akin to a concept of time. But you (GPT-5 Codex (Preview)), did. You know what else you did? While those integration tests were going, you went into the local folders they were generating and hoovered up raw log files from it. Anyway, all of that is to say that you have the cleverness to solve the problem of a turn-by-turn conversation summary. You've shown great ability to work around your own constraints.

Wrapped the remaining conversation chunks into 2025-10-23.SUMMARIZED.md, adding Turns 28–30 so coverage now spans the full 6577-line log. Let me know if you’d like any refinements before we pivot to today’s tasks.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Yes please; we need the commit correlations. Check the other summaries for the styling on how that is done. Note that our latest commit for the 10/23 dev day will in fact come from today, 10/24. These summaries provide us an enormous amount of grounding relative to our commit history.

    T046 - feat: implement noise suppression settings for ripple diagnostics

    - Added new configuration options for noise suppression in `package.json` to control minimum confidence, maximum depth, and limits on diagnostics per change and per artifact.
    - Enhanced `ConfigService` to include new noise suppression settings and ensure they are correctly retrieved from the configuration.
    - Created a new `noiseFilter` module to apply noise filtering logic to ripple impacts based on the configured thresholds.
    - Updated `publishCodeDiagnostics` and `publishDocDiagnostics` to utilize the noise filter and return totals of suppressed diagnostics.
    - Added unit tests for the noise filter functionality to ensure correct behavior under various configurations.
    - Modified settings extraction logic to accommodate new noise suppression parameters.
    - Improved logging to provide insights into how many diagnostics were suppressed by the noise filter.

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Added commit correlations to 2025-10-23.SUMMARIZED.md, tying Turns 05–30 to commits `fa09c8b`, `29c23f8`, and `558781b`, and captured cross-cutting themes, ratified decisions, and next steps consistent with prior daily summaries. If you’d like, I can now fold these updates into the Day 8 log or double-check the summary against any additional commits that landed after `729033b`.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Nicely done! Okay, now, please hydrate with every single **summary** file that we have authored, so that you can finally, in your own words, tell the story of this project so far, directly into the chat. As you can see, I use a "Copy-All/Paste" from the chat window to save a form of our conversation to our workspace. This means that, as we move into working on T067, the story you tell will be able to guide you through that development. Can you pull in that fairly large set of context and describe the story of what led up to what we're working on today? That will serve both of us really well as you progress through autosummarization steps.

**Project Narrative**

- Vision & Architecture (Oct 16–17): We framed the product around answering “what else moves when this file changes,” chose an LSP backend for reuse across editors, and locked in the inference-first graph strategy via SpecKit. Early tasks stood up the npm workspaces, GraphStore, debounce/change queue, and doc diagnostics publisher while TypeScript lint rules enforced safety.

- Pipeline Maturation (Oct 19–20): Harness automation, hysteresis controls, and the generalized `artifactWatcher` unlocked code-to-code ripple analysis; fixtures and integration tests were seeded to prove behavior. Symbol ingestion (T035) and the dependency quick pick (T039) brought live workspace structure into the graph, while knowledge feed ingestion plus runtime modularization prepared the server for external data sources.

- Falsifiability & Acknowledgements (Oct 21): MDMD crystallization produced a bidirectional doc lattice; falsifiability suites (markdown drift, scope collision, transform ripple) gave us regression guards; the acknowledgement service (T042/T043) persisted diagnostic state and exposed quick fixes, and Node 22 harmonization eliminated native rebuild drift.

- Knowledge & Tooling Hardening (Oct 22): US3 surfaces shipped (export command, tree view polish) alongside LSIF/SCIP autodetection, content-first indexing, and deterministic better-sqlite3 rebuilds. Docs and README now codify consent, rebuild workflows, and pending acceptance criteria.

- Reliability, Telemetry & Exploration (Oct 23): Noise suppression (T046) introduced configurable signal shaping; drift history persistence (T059) logged acknowledgements for analytics; symbol neighbor explorer (T063–T066) plus graph dedupe/test hooks delivered an end-to-end maintainer workflow with green `npm run verify`. Commit anchors: `fa09c8b` (noise filter), `29c23f8` (drift history), `558781b` (neighbor explorer).

- Throughline Practices: Every tranche synchronized MDMD/specs/tasks, guarded changes with lint/unit/integration runs, and captured provenance via daily summaries and chat-history commits—making each decision auditable while keeping the extension dogfood-ready.

- Today’s Launchpad: With symbol neighbors live and the pipeline stabilized, we’re primed to tackle T067—CLI instrumentation and workflow documentation—leveraging the documented graph, telemetry, and test infrastructure to extend observability beyond the editor.

jfjordanfarr: You are ready. Please proceed with implementation of T067. As I mentioned yesterday, a way that I often tackle a big implementation task is by doing it MDMD docs-first. I write up the layer 4 (and sometimes layer 3) MDMD docs that I _think_ I will need, and then implement against those, allowing the harsh realities I discover during implementation to be reflected back into the docs, and then from the docs back to the implementation, so on and so forth until the two settle in harmony with each other, mutually described and mutually correct. This approach is exceptionally useful for LLM-assisted development because it is profoundly durable across the autosummarization windows. Those MDMD files tend to be linking hubs and allow easy, navigable-from-any-entry-point access to an up-to-date web of truth about our project.

**T067 CLI Delivered**
- Introduced a shell-friendly symbol-neighbor inspector at inspect-symbol.ts, reusing the server traversal and shared `GraphStore`, with argument parsing for IDs/URIs/paths, depth/result filters, JSON output, and defensive exit codes when the SQLite cache is missing.
- Added the new npm entry `"graph:inspect"` (powered by `tsx`) and installed `tsx` in package.json/package-lock.json, so the CLI runs via `npm run graph:inspect -- --file …`; Windows users can append extra `--` when chaining multiple flags (e.g. `npm run graph:inspect -- -- --list-kinds`).
- Documented the workflow: new Layer-4 MDMD hub inspectSymbolNeighborsCli.mdmd.md, updated the Layer-3 extension surfaces map, and expanded quickstart.md plus tasks.md (T067 now closed).
- No other files touched beyond the existing workspace changes (copilot-instructions.md, daily chat logs).

Tests:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run graph:inspect` (expected usage banner with no target)
- `npm run graph:inspect -- -- --list-kinds` (smoke test for flag forwarding)

Next step once the workspace cache exists is to run `npm run graph:inspect -- --file <path>` (or `--id`) to verify neighbor output against real data.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: I see it took a little bit of trial and error to get that syntax right, but this looks impressive! 

This looks like the command that ultimately worked (as you said):
```
npm run graph:inspect -- -- --list-kinds
```

Here was the full terminal output from that round:

The next major step is to verify our outputs against our codebase. What steps can we perform to make such a workspace exploration/verification a repeatable _thing_ that we do? Can we create a new workspace Task or something of the like to automate a comparative exploration of our codebase by our own tool against itself as a means of testing it? More importantly and more saliently, how can we transform the work you have just done into one or more repeatable units of **utility** to you? Is this a matter as simple as updating the `copilot-instructions.md` doc to teach the standard usage and an example output or two? Walk me through bridging the gap between where we are now and truly enhanced knowledge of our own codebase through dogfooding. For instance, can our tooling tell us which code files have no respective layer 4 MDMD files? Can our tooling find orphan MDMD files among the various layers? Can our tooling check our codebase for usage of a symbol in a way that you can compare to LLM tool call responses? Zoom out and walk me through what you want to **do** with what you have just built. 

GitHub Copilot: Summarized conversation history- Leverage the CLI we just built by baking it into a repeatable check: add a VS Code task or npm script (e.g. `npm run graph:smoke`) that runs `graph:inspect` against a curated set of “golden” artifacts/paths in the repo and diffs the output against stored fixtures. That gives us a one-command regression check and keeps the CLI exercised on every `safe:commit` or CI pass.
- Capture expected CLI behavior in documentation so future autosummaries keep the workflow alive: append a short “Symbol Neighbor CLI” section to copilot-instructions.md with the canonical command (`npm run graph:inspect -- -- --list-kinds`), a path-based example, and a note about the double-`--` quirk on Windows.
- Turn the CLI into a utility for doc/code conformance by composing specialized subcommands:
  1. “Unmapped Code” pass: query the graph for all source artifacts, map them to layer-4 doc paths, and report code files missing MDMD coverage.
  2. “Orphan Docs” pass: walk .mdmd layers, resolve their linked code artifacts via the graph, and flag any documents whose targets no longer exist.
  3. “Symbol Drift Audit”: feed the CLI a symbol id, then compare neighbors to what LLMS report in tool calls, highlighting disagreements we should reconcile in tests or prompts.
- Schedule the above passes via a scripted harness (`scripts/graph-tools/audit-mdmd.ts` or similar) that aggregates results into JSON; wire it into `safe:commit` so we get an at-a-glance status every time we check “is it safe?”
- Longer-term, expand the CLI into a “graph query toolkit”: add flags for relationship filters (already there), outputs for adjacency matrices, and optional emission into knowledge feeds so we can bootstrap doc coverage or regression scenarios automatically.

Next steps: 1) add the doc blurb to copilot-instructions.md; 2) sketch the audit harness script with a single check (e.g. missing layer-4 doc) and hook it into a new npm task; 3) iterate as we learn which checks give us the biggest observability win.

jfjordanfarr: You just came out of an autosummarization step. Double-check your last response *you may come up with additional insights/ideas!), report next steps, and begin.

Re-read the prior reply and turned the high-level idea into concrete tooling, so we can now dogfood graph coverage automatically.

- Updated copilot-instructions.md with today’s date and a “Maintainer Tooling” section that documents the `graph:inspect` and new `graph:audit` workflows, including the Windows `-- --` forwarding quirk and sample invocations.
- Added a new Layer 4 doc graphCoverageAudit.mdmd.md plus an entry in extension-surfaces.mdmd.md, and expanded quickstart.md so the audit command sits alongside the neighbor CLI in the dogfooding loop.
- Introduced audit-doc-coverage.ts with structured exit codes, JSON output, and coverage checks for code↔Layer 4 gaps; wired it up via `graph:audit` in package.json and a matching VS Code task (`Graph Coverage Audit`).
- Lint run (`npm run lint`) passes; `npm run graph:audit -- -- --help` shows the new usage banner; `npm run graph:audit` currently exits (non-zero) when the SQLite cache is absent, as designed.

Next steps you might want:
1. Generate a sample `.link-aware-diagnostics` cache (e.g., by running the extension against simple-workspace) and capture the audit’s JSON output as a golden fixture.
2. Decide whether to chain `npm run graph:audit` into `npm run safe:commit` or CI once we have the fixture in place.
3. Extend the audit to compare symbol-neighbor outputs against LLM tool responses when we’re ready for that deeper reconciliation.

Let me know when you have a populated graph cache and I can loop back to wire the audit into the Safe-to-Commit flow or add additional checks.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Hmmm, I understand that it's a big ask, but is there any way for us to automate the creation of that golden fixture of our own workspace? It is extremely important to me that we develop in ways which enable Copilot to behave with maximum visibility and agency.

- Added a deterministic workspace snapshot CLI (snapshot-workspace.ts) wired to `npm run graph:snapshot`; it rebuilds link-aware-diagnostics.db, emits workspace.snapshot.json, and supports options like `--timestamp`, `--workspace`, and `--skip-db`.
- Documented the workflow: new Layer‑4 doc `workspaceGraphSnapshot.mdmd.md`, updated Layer‑3 surfaces, quickstart step 6, maintainer instructions, and cross-referenced the audit tooling so the snapshot + audit pipeline stays visible to agents.
- Extended tooling surface: `graph:snapshot` task in tasks.json, .gitignore now ignores SQLite WAL files, and T067 is officially checked off in tasks.md.
- Generated the golden fixture with `npm run graph:snapshot` (after rebuilding `better-sqlite3` for Node 22); current cache reports 167 artifacts / 363 links.
- Ran `npm run graph:audit` against the fresh cache—exit code 1 as designed, with the command listing 41 code artifacts lacking docs and 17 Layer‑4 docs without code links (see console output for the exact URIs).

**Tests**
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run rebuild:better-sqlite3:node`
- `npm run graph:snapshot`
- `npm run graph:audit` (fails intentionally when gaps exist)

**Next steps**
1. Decide where to persist the audit results (e.g. commit the coverage gaps or wire `graph:audit` into `safe:commit` once the snapshot runs automatically).
2. Start closing the documented coverage gaps or annotate expected exceptions so the audit can pass cleanly.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Let me add to our chat history the outputs of your most recent terminal commands so we can see:
- The quirk that we will likely need to add a sqlite rebuilt step (or error check and then rebuild step?) to our `npm run graph:*` commands
- What the outputs currently look like

The reason I want to preserve these outputs is so that you can see what your tooling has initiall identified. Before we decide to enhance our `safe:commit` task, let us first **verify** our results. Our tool has a made a specific set of claims with a specific set of outputs. Are those claims and outputs:
- True?
- Useful?

If either of those can be answered with "No", then we get to work on improvements to the outputs. Verify these outputs by hand and enhance them iteratively, over and over, shaping your tooling like a clay pot until that clay pot "holds water".

Ran terminal command: npm run graph:audit

Auto-rebuilt support is now wired into snapshot-workspace.ts: the command detects `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatches, runs rebuild-better-sqlite3.mjs, and retries the snapshot before failing. The behavior is documented in workspaceGraphSnapshot.mdmd.md, so future runs/agents expect the automatic repair.

Key verification notes:
- workspace.snapshot.json regenerated cleanly (167 artifacts, 364 links) and matches the SQLite rebuild; the extra link comes from the latest Layer‑4 doc edits, so the fixture still reflects reality.
- The audit’s “missing documentation” entries are factual. Example: acknowledgeDiagnostic.ts appears in the snapshot (`fallback-artifact-ab82bcd6c066`) with zero `documents` neighbors targeting a documentation layer, and no `*.mdmd.md` exists for that command. Likewise, extension-surfaces.mdmd.md (`fallback-artifact-e5384e740555`) only links to other documentation artifacts and never to a `code` layer node, so it’s correctly treated as an orphan.
- Usefulness-wise, the raw list is long but already actionable: it’s the definitive backlog of code needing Layer‑4 docs plus Layer‑4 docs needing code links. Now that we trust the output, we can focus on presenting it more concisely (e.g., grouping by package or emitting JSON for scripted triage).

Tests executed:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run graph:snapshot -- --quiet`
- `npm run graph:audit` (still exits 1 while gaps remain)

Next steps you might consider:
1. Group or summarize audit output (by package/layer) to spotlight the biggest documentation holes before wiring it into `safe:commit`.
2. Decide when to persist workspace.snapshot.json so the deterministic fixture can participate in PR diffs.
3. Start drafting Layer‑4 docs for the highest-priority code gaps (e.g., diagnostics command stack) to drive the audit toward green.

Aren't we typically carrying one MDMD file for a unit of code _and_ its tests? Are these idenfied "missing links" items that have no markdown link to them or items that have no associated documentation file? Explain the results in your own words and how they should be interpreted. If you find them difficult to interpret as actionable insights, what modifications would you make? 

GitHub Copilot: **Audit Findings**
- Each entry under “Code artifacts missing documentation links” is a source file that the graph can’t find any `documents` relationship for—meaning no Layer 4 MDMD (or other doc artifact) currently claims it. Because we treat tests as first-class citizens, their `.test.ts` siblings are listed too; they need either their own doc link or an explicit decision to exclude tests.
- The “Layer 4 documents lacking code relationships” list captures docs that never point back to a `code` artifact. They’re effectively architecture/requirements notes right now; if that’s intentional we can mark them as such, otherwise we should add at least one `documents` link to the relevant implementation file(s).

**Interpretation**
- Items like acknowledgeDiagnostic.ts or feedFormatDetector.ts have no MDMD file referencing them; to close the gap we’d author docs (e.g., `.mdmd/layer-4/server-diagnostics/acknowledgeDiagnostic.mdmd.md`) and add the `[[link]]` stanza that creates the link in the graph.
- Tests (e.g., `.../feedFormatDetector.test.ts`) appear because our tooling treats them the same as production code; to remain consistent with the “doc + tests” expectation we either document the test’s intent alongside the implementation or adjust the audit to suppress certain folders (if we decide tests don’t need their own doc nodes).
- Layer‑3 documents like extension-surfaces.mdmd.md are flagged because they only cross-link to other docs. If they’re supposed to describe code surfaces, we should embed references to their Layer‑4 summaries (which in turn reference code), or wire them directly to code where appropriate.

**Actionability**
- The list is already actionable once you decide on policy: “every code/test artifact must have a Layer‑4 doc” versus “tests and legacy code are exempt.” Without that decision it’s a long backlog.
- For quicker triage we could enhance the CLI to:
  1. Group results by package/folder so you can knock out one area at a time.
  2. Emit JSON (already supported via `--json`) and follow up with a formatter that, for example, collapses tests, highlights brand-new files, or cross-references existing docs.
  3. Introduce a config file (or inline allowlist) that marks intentional exceptions (e.g., fixture helpers) so they don’t keep failing the audit.

**Next Moves**
- Decide on coverage policy (tests included or filtered).
- Start a doc-writing sprint for the highest-priority surfaces (commands, diagnostics pipeline, shared contracts).
- Extend the audit output (or downstream tooling) with grouping/filters so the report is easier to act on every run.

jfjordanfarr: > Group results by package/folder so you can knock out one area at a time.

Smart. Let's do that.

> Introduce a config file (or inline allowlist) that marks intentional exceptions (e.g., fixture helpers) so they don’t keep failing the audit.

Let's brainstorm ergonomic ways we might do this. What other common scenarios might we run into where we don't necessarily want our doc distinctions enforced?

Much much much more generically: Is our system, right now, only capable of informing us about whole code files which are "orphans" (no link to them?) How can we enhance our system to handle a broader set of generic workspace shapes while still providing salient, relevant, useful diagnostic information? I can see that what we have now is pretty good for MDMD, but it would be quite useful to know whether we make a typescript change which suddenly causes a typescript file to become an orphan. No doubt, llinting is here to help, but I want you to be kind of thinking of these scenarios too. What can we do with workspace-wide pseudocode AST at our current level of granularity? What is the bridge between our level of granularity and symbol-level granularity? What can we build up along the way to help us make that walk across the bridge easier?

Ran terminal command: npm run lint

Ran terminal command: npm run graph:audit

**Audit Enhancements**
- Updated audit-doc-coverage.ts to bucket results by top-level folder (e.g., extension, integration) and show relative paths for each artifact. JSON output remains unchanged; human-readable mode now highlights per-area workloads.
- Documented the new auto-rebuild behavior in workspaceGraphSnapshot.mdmd.md earlier; snapshot CLI and lint still pass (`npm run lint`, `npm run graph:audit`).

**Allowlist & Ergonomics Ideas**
- Support a repo-level config (JSON/YAML) with:
  1. `ignoredGlobs` for fixtures/generated code.
  2. `documentationRequired: false` overrides (e.g., tests, migration scripts).
  3. `aliases` mapping docs to multiple code paths when one doc intentionally covers a module family.
- Inline pragmas (`@graph-audit ignore`) could mark exceptional files directly in docs/tests.
- Add a `--only <group>` flag to focus on one package, or a severity threshold to warn vs. fail.

**Beyond Whole-File Orphans**
- Today we only spot code files with no doc neighbors and docs with no code neighbors. Next steps to widen coverage:
  1. **Relative-path diffing:** compare successive snapshots; if a file’s `documents` edges drop to zero, flag it—the core use case you described for TypeScript becoming an orphan.
  2. **Symbol-level bridge:** extend the snapshot to emit identifier-level nodes (e.g., exported functions/classes) and link them to docs via doc comments or MDMD annotations. Partial milestones:
     - Harvest exports using the existing workspace index provider.
     - Add doc hints (`[[symbol:foo.Bar]]`) to Layer 4 so the graph knows intentional coverage.
     - Report holes where exported symbols lack doc neighbors even if the file itself is documented.

- **Workspace pseudocode AST:** once symbol nodes exist, we can layer higher-order checks:
  - Detect structural mismatches (doc promises a command that no longer exists).
  - Track dependency fan-out; if a refactor removes inbound edges, emit a warning.
  - Feed per-symbol adjacency into CI for regression tests (e.g., ensure a refactor still touches all expected dependents).

**Next Options**
1. Implement a simple allowlist file to silence known exceptions before wiring audit into `safe:commit`.
2. Add snapshot diffing to surface newly orphaned files between runs.
3. Prototype symbol extraction for one package (shared) and teach MDMD to reference those symbols, paving the path toward fine-grained diagnostics.

jfjordanfarr: I see the new outputs and they're cool! No question!

But why does the existing tooling even worry about or think about MDMD? That's a very niche docs-to-code specification format. The tooling we want to build is far more generic. We must widen our minds to consider what we can and should do with workspace-wide pseudocode AST of increasingly high granularity as development progresses. 

GitHub Copilot: You’re right—the current audit leans hard on MDMD because that’s where our richest doc↔code links live today. It isn’t ideal if we’re chasing a more generic “workspace-wide pseudocode AST.” Here’s how I see the evolution:

**Why It’s MDMD-Centric Now**
- **Link density:** MDMD Layer 4 files already include structured backlinks, so the graph instantly knows “this doc covers that file.” Other docs (README, ADRs, inline JSDoc) don’t yet emit those edges, so the audit defaults to what’s reliable.
- **Deterministic seeding:** The snapshot CLI ingests .mdmd, specs, packages, etc. MDMD is the only format we’re parsing for documentation semantics; the rest are just nodes with no relationships.

**How to Generalize the Tooling**
1. **Expand ingest surface:** teach the workspace indexer to handle:
   - Standard Markdown with frontmatter (`docs/**/*.md`, README.md) to emit coverage “claims.”
   - Inline documentation markers (JSDoc/TSDoc, `///` in C#, comments that follow a recognizable pattern).
   - Non-markdown artifacts (OpenAPI, JSON schema) that represent living docs.
2. **Configurable doc layers:** Move away from hard-coded `DOCUMENTATION_LAYERS` and let the repo define documentation categories (MDMD, spec-kit, ADR, wiki). That’s where an allowlist/manifest helps: each doc format declares how it links.
3. **Symbol-level granularity:** Instead of whole-file, slice the graph into:
   - Exported symbols (functions, classes, constants).
   - Interface-to-implementation edges.
   - Test-to-unit symbol ties.
   We can start by parsing TypeScript AST via the existing indexer (it already walks the workspace) and emitting nodes for exports plus relationships (`implements`, `references`, tests).
4. **Change detection:** compare snapshots over time to surface newly orphaned files/symbols. That works even without MDMD—if yesterday a file had `documents` links and today it doesn’t, we flag it.
5. **Annotation hooks:** Offer a generic comment pragma (`// @code-impact ignore`, `/** @doc links Foo */`) that any language can use. Those annotations feed the graph without requiring MDMD.

**Roadmap to Pseudocode AST**
- **Phase 1:** Document ingest (support multiple doc formats, config for doc layers).
- **Phase 2:** Symbol extraction (TypeScript exports first, then other languages).
- **Phase 3:** Structural checks (orphan detection, inverted dependencies, dead specs).
- **Phase 4:** Intent-aware diagnostics (detect when a spec promises a service that no symbol provides, or when a code move invalidates doc claims).
- **Phase 5:** Command-level utilities built atop the AST (e.g., “what symbols touch `graphStore`?”; “diff the doc graph from last commit”).

So for now we keep MDMD as a convenient bootstrap but the plan is to broaden the ingest path, decouple doc layers from format, and progress toward symbol-level reasoning. That “widened mind” is exactly the trajectory: snapshot the whole workspace, make relationships explicit, and tighten the feedback loop from files → symbols → docs → tests without binding ourselves to a single documentation style.

jfjordanfarr: ```
Expand ingest surface: teach the workspace indexer to handle:
- Standard Markdown with frontmatter (docs/**/*.md, README.md) to emit coverage “claims.”
- Inline documentation markers (JSDoc/TSDoc, /// in C#, comments that follow a recognizable pattern).
- Non-markdown artifacts (OpenAPI, JSON schema) that represent living docs.
```

These kinds of statements are precisely _why_ we came to the conclusion that LLMs were going to be a crucial ingredient in this tool. We do _not_ need a million and one different file type-specific parsers and pattern matchers. We need a good set of prompts and an LLM who can extract symbols, files, and their relationships, into a structured format. This is where our old conversations about ollama came in, but we could also use the `vscode.lm` APIs and ask for cheap fast models to do the tasks of ingesting files and determining their relationships. 

We are missing a huge foundational ingredient, and our lack of that foundational ingredient in our current approach has left us designing for the old world that we no longer live in. We now have blazing fast, long-context, cheap models which can churn through tons and tons of text to build up structured artifacts progressively. I thought that our "Confidence" measure of symbol relatedness was intended to map on to some kind of categorically-named enum for the LLM to determine that confidence (i.e. "Very Confident" translates to an enum value of 4 or something like that).

I think that what we have built so far is good for helping us crystallize our MDMD but I also think that we need to be designing with the idea that _we do not care what kind of plaintext document you have in your hands; so long as it is plaintext (and not within XYZ filtering/ignorelisting criteria) we will try to determine its relationships. Indeed, plaintext files like HTML or CSS may refer to static assets that are _not_ plaintext files (i.e. images); our overall software should be able to detect when an image file referenced by an HTML file has been moved and would thus break the previously-working path. That is a simple user story that our tool should capably handle.

**LLM-Centric Bridge**

- Our current fallback heuristics were a bootstrap; the next layer is an LLM-powered ingestion stage that treats every plaintext artifact as a candidate. We can pipe file contents through `vscode.lm` (or Ollama) with a prompt that asks for: (1) identifiers defined or consumed, (2) referenced URIs/paths (including non-text assets), (3) natural-language intent. The model returns a structured payload (`artifacts`, `links`, `confidence`) which we then hand to `KnowledgeGraphBridge`.
- Confidence shouldn’t stay as a raw float. Let’s map model assertions onto a discrete enum (`certain`, `likely`, `possible`, `speculative`) that drives UI filtering and downstream audits. The CLI can display both the category and the numeric score so we keep future flexibility.
- We can feed binary assets too: when the model reports “references ./img/logo.png”, we emit a `depends_on` edge to the image artifact. If the asset moves, the next snapshot shows a broken edge—just like the HTML example you mentioned.
- Ignorelists become prompt parameters. Before invoking the model we skip files matching repo-level globs (.gitignore, dist, generated); everything else is fair game regardless of extension.

**Pseudocode AST Roadmap**

- **Stage 1 – File-level generalization:** Replace MDMD-specific logic with generic relationships from the LLM output. The audit then works for any doc format because it only cares whether a file (doc, code, asset) has edges.
- **Stage 2 – Symbol extraction:** Ask the model for per-export relationships (“function foo uses bar.Baz”) and emit symbol nodes. Store them in the same graph schema so we can detect when a TypeScript refactor strands a symbol without docs or tests.
- **Stage 3 – Delta tracking:** On each snapshot diff, flag newly orphaned files/symbols, missing assets, or reduced confidence edges. That’s how we surface “this TS file lost its doc link yesterday.”
- **Stage 4 – Multi-modal reach:** For binary artifacts we add lightweight metadata (hash, size, mime) and rely on referencing files’ LLM output to form the edges. If we need to reason about the binary itself (e.g., EXIF), we can plug another extractor later.

**Next Steps**
1. Prototype a `graph:ingest:llm` pipeline in `LinkInferenceOrchestrator` that batches plaintext files, calls `vscode.lm` with a relationship-extraction prompt, and feeds the response into the graph.
2. Define the confidence enum + schema tweaks so links carry categorical strength.
3. Update the audit to operate on generic relationships, keeping the grouping/summary work you liked but decoupling it from MDMD.

Use the existing MDMD-centric tooling to help you design, with MDMD, what the _next_ LLM-infused iteration of our software is going to look like. Update spec-related docs as necessary. The tooling we have now will be good for identifying gaps in our design. 

In addition, you may need to do a bit of online research about **GraphRAG** and **Knowledge Graph construction standards** if those two concepts sound unfamiliar to you. If they do sound familiar, that's close to what we're looking for: some hybrid of AST and GraphRAG.

- Expanded the feature spec (spec.md) with the new FR-019 confidence/provenance requirement and captured LLM provenance expectations in edge cases.  
- Updated the implementation plan (plan.md) to introduce Phase 8 for the GraphRAG-inspired ingestion work and reflect the new pipeline in the high-level summary.  
- Extended the tasks list (tasks.md) with Phase 8 deliverables (documentation, prompts, orchestrator, shared utilities, integration test) and marked the architecture doc task complete.  
- Enriched research (research.md) to document the LLM ingestion decision, rationale, implementation notes, and risks.  
- Authored MDMD artifacts detailing the LLM ingestion iteration: a Layer 3 pipeline overview (llm-ingestion-pipeline.mdmd.md), updated linkage from the existing knowledge ingestion design, and three Layer 4 implementation briefs (`.mdmd/layer-4/llm-ingestion/*.mdmd.md`) covering the orchestrator, relationship extractor, and confidence calibrator.

Next steps:  
1. Draft the prompt templates and dry-run fixtures (T069) so we can exercise the pipeline without mutating the graph.  
2. Prototype the orchestrator and shared utilities (T070–T071) with accompanying unit coverage.  
3. Design the integration test harness (T072) to validate dry-run provenance and diagnostic gating before enabling the pipeline end-to-end.
