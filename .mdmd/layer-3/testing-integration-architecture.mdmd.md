# Integration Testing Architecture

## Metadata
- Layer: 3
- Component IDs: COMP-008

## Components

### COMP-008 Integration Test Harness
Supports FR-LD1 through FR-LD6 plus REQ-F1 to REQ-F6 by executing end-to-end scenarios that validate Live Documentation regeneration, diagnostics accuracy, knowledge ingestion, and ripple behaviour across the built extension and server.

## Responsibilities

### Deterministic Execution
- Build fresh extension/server bundles before runs and clean stale artifacts with `tests/integration/clean-dist.mjs`.
- Launch the VS Code harness (`tests/integration/vscode/runTests.ts`) to execute suites against compiled output rather than source mocks.

### Fixture Stewardship
- Maintain the simple workspace fixture (`tests/integration/fixtures/simple-workspace`) as the canonical testbed for US1–US4.
- Provide specialised fixtures (LLM ingestion payloads, benchmark repos) for targeted suites without duplicating workspace state.

### Scenario Coverage
- Ensure suites `us1` through `us5` cover writer, developer, scope collision, acknowledgement, and transform ripple flows.
- Add Live Documentation suites (`live-docs-generation`, `live-docs-evidence`, `live-docs-inspect-cli`, `live-docs-docstring-drift`) validating regeneration determinism, evidence population, CLI parity, and drift remediation.
- Keep suite responsibilities mapped back to runtime components (Live Doc generator, diagnostics pipeline, knowledge ingestion, LLM bridge) for traceability.

### Harness Strategy & Options
- **Immediate path (Options 1 + 4)**: retain the VS Code harness for UI/diagnostics flows while carving out a lightweight headless runner that replays the same suites against compiled artifacts using a sandboxed fixture. This preserves UX coverage and gives us a deterministic harness for CLI, generator, and hosted showcase rehearsal without pulling Electron into every scenario.
- **Option 2 headless harness**: `npm run live-docs:headless -- --scenario <name>` now copies benchmark fixtures into a temp workspace, drives the shared generator/system builders, and writes timestamped reports under `AI-Agent-Workspace/tmp/headless-harness/<scenario>/`. Scenarios (`ruby-cli`, `python-basics`, `csharp-advanced`) live in `packages/server/src/features/live-docs/harness/scenarios.ts`, guaranteeing every language bridge remains green without launching VS Code.
- **Option 3 container harness**: passing `--container-spec` emits `container-spec.json` beside each headless report describing the Node 22 image, mount expectations, and command invocation so the Cloudflare hosted showcase can replay scenarios verbatim. These specs keep hosted rehearsals honest while remaining optional for local runs.
- Keep VS Code and headless/container harnesses independent even after the core extraction so regressions in one surface do not mask the other. Hosted showcase validations must point to the headless/container harness to guarantee parity with the Cloudflare runner while acknowledging the marketing-only positioning.

### Artefact Capture
- Persist run outputs (snapshot JSON, logs, Live Doc markdown fixtures, provenance files) in per-suite temp directories for inspection and regression comparisons.
- Headless harness runs deposit `report.json` + optional `container-spec.json` inside `AI-Agent-Workspace/tmp/headless-harness/<scenario>/<timestamp>/` and leave the generated `.live-documentation/` mirrors inside the copied workspace whenever `--keep-workspace` is supplied for manual spot checks.

## Interfaces

### Inbound Interfaces
- `npm run test:integration` (and safe-to-commit) orchestrations that call the VS Code harness.
- Fixture configuration toggles controlling which suites execute, allowing targeted regression runs.

### Outbound Interfaces
- Mocha logs, snapshot files, and staged Live Doc mirrors stored under `tests/integration/.tmp` for debugging.
- Report contributions consumed by the benchmark/reporting pipeline, including Live Doc precision/recall metrics.

## Linked Implementations

### IMP-401 vscodeIntegrationHarness
Bootstraps VS Code with compiled artifacts and loads suites. [VS Code Integration Harness](../../.mdmd/layer-4/tests/integration/vscode/runTests.ts.mdmd.md)

### IMP-402 simpleWorkspaceFixture
Primary workspace assets used across US suites. [Simple Workspace Fixture](../../.mdmd/layer-4/tests/integration/fixtures/simple-workspace/scripts/applyTemplate.ts.mdmd.md)

### IMP-403 us1ThroughUs5 Suites
Scenario implementations verifying ripple, writer, developer, scope collision, and transform flows. [US Integration Suites](../../.mdmd/layer-4/tests/integration/us1/codeImpact.test.ts.mdmd.md)

### IMP-404 cleanDistUtility
Removes stale bundles before integration runs. [Clean Dist Utility](../../tests/integration/clean-dist.mjs)

### IMP-405 liveDocsGenerationSuite
Exercises regeneration CLI, authored preservation, and deterministic output. [Stage‑0 Live Doc](../../.mdmd/layer-4/tests/integration/live-docs/generation.test.ts.mdmd.md)

### IMP-406 liveDocsEvidenceSuite
Validates evidence ingestion, lint warnings, and `_No automated evidence found_` behaviour. [Stage‑0 Live Doc](../../.mdmd/layer-4/tests/integration/live-docs/evidence.test.ts.mdmd.md)

### IMP-407 liveDocsInspectCliSuite
CLI parity suite remains on the roadmap; capture its responsibility once the corresponding Stage-0 doc materialises.

### IMP-408 liveDocsDocstringDriftSuite
Drift remediation suite remains planned; update this entry after initial implementation lands in Stage-0 Live Docs.

## Evidence
- Integration suites US1–US5 run inside CI and `npm run test:integration`, asserting diagnostics accuracy, acknowledgement flows, and knowledge ingestion behaviour.
- Planned Live Doc suites (`tests/integration/live-docs/*.test.ts`) will run alongside US suites to gate regeneration parity, evidence coverage, CLI parity, and drift remediation.
- Harness unit tests (`runTests.test.ts`, planned) verify extension attachment and suite registration.
- Safe-to-commit orchestration depends on integration success before passing.

## Operational Notes
- Snapshot directories remain isolated per suite to ease diffing pre/post change.
- Adding a new scenario requires extending the fixture set and documenting its responsibility here to preserve traceability.
- Maintain distinct runbooks for the VS Code harness and the headless/container harness so hosted showcase rehearsals (Cloudflare pipeline) never depend on Electron-specific behaviours; both harnesses must share compiled artifacts but publish independent logs.
