# Diagnostics Pipeline Architecture (Layer 3)

## Overview
Synchronises on-disk artifact changes with the knowledge graph to emit actionable ripple diagnostics inside VS Code.

- **Extension front-end**: watchers/fileMaintenance sends rename/delete notifications; document selectors in `extension.ts` ensure YAML + markdown feed change events into the language client.
- **Change ingestion**: `ArtifactWatcher` classifies saved artifacts as document vs. code, loads contents, seeds providers, and reconciles inference hints against `GraphStore`.
- **Ripple analysis**: `changeProcessor.ts` persists change events, runs `RippleAnalyzer`, and collates ripple impacts for code+document contexts.
- **Diagnostic publication**:
  - `publishDocDiagnostics` surfaces broken markdown links and ripple metadata for docs.
  - `publishCodeDiagnostics` (existing) handles code ripple hints with hysteresis + batching.
  - `removeOrphans` responds to rename/delete notifications, notifying clients and sending interim diagnostics.
- **Client UX**: `docDiagnosticProvider` transforms diagnostic metadata into quick actions and ripple explorers.

## Data Flow
1. **Save Event** *(VS Code)*
   - Language client enqueues `QueuedChange` (URI, languageId, version) to `changeQueue` with debounce.
2. **Artifact Preparation** *(ArtifactWatcher)*
   - Determines category via language/extension heuristics (now includes `.yaml`, `.yml`).
   - Loads text, aggregates workspace + knowledge feed hints, records inference seeds.
3. **Inference & Graph Sync**
   - Runs orchestrators (workspace providers, knowledge feeds, LLM fallback) and persists new edges via `persistInferenceResult`.
   - Normalises URIs (`normalizeFileUri`) to keep graph canonical.
4. **Ripple Analysis**
   - `RippleAnalyzer` generates hints limited by runtime settings (depth, max results, allowed kinds).
   - Splits document/code contexts; attaches cascade metadata (path, confidence, relationship).
5. **Noise Filtering**
   - `noiseFilter` trims low-confidence or redundant ripple impacts based on the active noise suppression preset before publication.
   - Suppression metrics feed runtime logging so operators can tune thresholds.
6. **Diagnostics Emission**
   - `publishDocDiagnostics` emits `doc-drift` records for:
     - Broken markdown paths (new static scan).
     - Ripple impacts referencing linked artifacts.
   - `publishCodeDiagnostics` emits `code-ripple` records for dependent code artifacts.
   - Diagnostics guarded by hysteresis + budget from runtime settings.
7. **Client Presentation**
   - `docDiagnosticProvider` registers quick actions (`Open linked artifact`, ripple explorer).
   - `fileMaintenance.ts` signals rename/delete back to server, triggering `removeOrphans` diagnostics + rebind prompts.

## Key Settings & Controls
- `RuntimeSettings.noiseSuppression` configures max diagnostics per batch + hysteresis window.
- `linkAwareDiagnostics.enableDiagnostics` toggles entire pipeline; extension ensures YAML is included in watchers.
- `linkAwareDiagnostics.llmProviderMode` must be set (guarded by providerGate) before diagnostics ship.

## Test Coverage
- **Unit**: `publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts`, `artifactWatcher.test.ts`, `docDiagnosticProvider.test.ts`, `rippleAnalyzer.test.ts`.
- **Integration**: US1â€“US5 suites validate writer, developer, rename, and template ripple flows using fixture workspace `tests/integration/fixtures/simple-workspace`.
- **Verify task**: `npm run verify` orchestrates lint, unit, integration before commits.

## Open Issues / Next Steps
- Extend architecture doc with knowledge-feed ingestion paths once external feeds are added (T05x).
- Document acknowledgement/lead workflows in a sibling layer-3 file once US3 (P3 story) is active.
- Evaluate performance telemetry for ripple analyzer (timings, graph size) prior to scaling to larger workspaces.
