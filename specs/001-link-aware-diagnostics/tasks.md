---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Developers see code-change impact (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Raise diagnostics on every code artifact impacted by a change so engineers know the full ripple before merging

**Independent Test**: Editing a code file in a benchmark workspace triggers diagnostics on all dependent modules without relying on documentation features

**Checkpoint**: Code-change impact is fully functional and independently testable

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Writers get drift alerts (Priority: P2)

**Checkpoint**: Documentation drift diagnostics operate on top of the unified graph

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Leads resolve alerts efficiently (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide acknowledgement workflows and consolidated views so leads can manage drift signals

**Independent Test**: Acknowledging diagnostics clears them until new changes and exports summaries without relying on prior stories

- [x] T042 [P] [US3] Add integration test `tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts` covering acknowledgement flow, hysteresis release, and settings overrides

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T043 [US3] Implement acknowledgement service with SQLite persistence and settings awareness in `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/acknowledgementService.ts`
- [x] T044 [P] [US3] Create diagnostics tree view provider in `packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts`

**Checkpoint**: All user stories independently functional with full workflow coverage


## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Maintainers explore symbol neighborhoods (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Provide dogfooding tooling so maintainers and Copilot agents can inspect graph neighborhoods for any symbol or artifact prior to relying on LLM explainability.

**Independent Test**: Invoking the “Inspect Symbol Neighbors” command (or CLI) returns hop-limited neighbors grouped by relationship kind without mutating diagnostics.

- [x] T063 [P] [US4] Add server-side traversal unit tests in `packages/server/src/features/dependencies/symbolNeighbors.test.ts` covering hop limits, relationship grouping, and confidence ordering
- [x] T064 [US4] Implement neighbor traversal service in `packages/server/src/features/dependencies/symbolNeighbors.ts` that queries the graph store and enforces hop/depth limits
- [x] T065 [P] [US4] Expose an LSP request/response contract in `packages/server/src/main.ts` & `packages/shared/src/contracts/diagnostics.ts` (or new contract) with telemetry hooks for future LLM usage
- [x] T066 [US4] Implement VS Code command palette + quick pick UI in `packages/extension/src/commands/inspectSymbolNeighbors.ts` consuming the LSP request and rendering grouped results
- [x] T067 [P] [US4] Add a developer-focused CLI entry (e.g., `scripts/graph-tools/inspect-symbol.ts`) and document workflow in `.mdmd/layer-4/extension-services` or quickstart appendix for internal dogfooding

- [x] T077 Update safe-to-commit, README, and MDMD docs to cover asset + symbol audits and their configuration gates

## Implementation Traceability
- [`packages/server/src/main.ts`](../../packages/server/src/main.ts), [`packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts`](../../packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts), and [`packages/server/src/runtime/knowledgeFeeds.ts`](../../packages/server/src/runtime/knowledgeFeeds.ts) map directly to the server-side tasks enumerated above.
- [`packages/extension/src/extension.ts`](../../packages/extension/src/extension.ts), [`packages/extension/src/watchers/fileMaintenance.ts`](../../packages/extension/src/watchers/fileMaintenance.ts), and [`packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts`](../../packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts) fulfill the extension deliverables outlined throughout the task list.
- [`packages/shared/src/domain/artifacts.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/domain/artifacts.ts), [`packages/shared/src/db/graphStore.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/db/graphStore.ts), and [`packages/shared/src/inference/linkInference.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/inference/linkInference.ts) provide the shared infrastructure referenced in Phase 1 and later phases.
- [`tests/integration/us1/codeImpact.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/us1/codeImpact.test.ts), [`tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts), and [`tests/integration/us5/transformRipple.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/us5/transformRipple.test.ts) enforce the test coverage called out alongside each user story.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: Setup must complete before foundational work
- **Phase 2 → Phases 3-5**: Foundational tasks (including configuration, watcher plumbing, hysteresis scaffolding) block all user stories
- **Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5**: Stories prioritized P1 → P2 → P3; later stories can start once foundational is done but should respect priority unless staffing allows parallel execution
- **Phase 6**: Runs after desired user stories are complete

### User Story Dependencies
- **US1**: Depends only on Phase 2 completion
- **US2**: Depends on Phase 2; enriches but does not strictly depend on US1 implementations
- **US3**: Depends on Phase 2; consumes diagnostics produced by earlier stories but can be developed independently using seeded data

### Task Dependencies (Highlights)
- T031 depends on T027–T030
- T033 depends on T043 (acknowledgement state definitions) and T017 (settings propagation)
- T038 depends on T035–T037
- T041 depends on T017–T019 and T025
- T056 depends on T055 and T025
- T052 depends on T022 and T038
- T057 depends on T054, T028, and T058

---

## Parallel Opportunities
- Marked `[P]` tasks across phases (e.g., T003, T004, T006, T008, T011, T013, T015, T017, T020, T024, T028, T032, T034, T036, T039, T044, T047, T049, T050, T053, T055, T058) can proceed concurrently once prerequisites finish
- Different user stories can be staffed in parallel after Phase 2, with coordination to avoid file conflicts
- Within each story, tests (T022, T030, T036) can be drafted while implementation scaffolding proceeds

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1)
1. Complete Phases 1 and 2
2. Deliver Phase 3 (US1) and validate via T022
3. Ship MVP to pilot teams for early feedback

### Incremental Delivery
1. Extend MVP with Phase 4 (US2) diagnostics for developers
2. Add Phase 5 (US3) management workflows when teams are ready for operational tracking
3. Finish with Phase 6 polish before broader rollout, including telemetry and performance validation

### Parallel Team Strategy
- Engineer A: Leads Phase 2 data store, configuration plumbing, and server backbone (T005–T021)
- Engineer B: Drives US1 implementation (T022–T029)
- Engineer C: Builds US2 dependency intelligence (T030–T035)
- Engineer D: Owns US3 acknowledgement tooling and AI opt-in (T036–T041)
- Shared effort: Polish tasks and instrumentation (T042–T047)
