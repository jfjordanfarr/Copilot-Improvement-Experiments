# Tasks: Live Documentation

**Inputs**: `/specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md`, `/specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/plan.md`, Layer‑1/Layer‑2 MDMD
**Prerequisites**: Safe-commit pipeline operational, analyzer benchmark harnesses green, `.github/instructions/mdmd.layer4*.instructions.md`

**Tests**: Phases declare the independent scenarios that satisfy Live Documentation user stories. Stage-specific regression suites live under `tests/integration/live-docs/` (to be created) and existing benchmark harnesses.

**Organization**: Tasks align with the adoption stages and phases defined in the implementation plan. IDs follow `LD-<Stage><Sequence>` to track progress against FR-LD requirements and WI-LD work items.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Phase/Story] Description`
- **[P]**: May proceed in parallel once prerequisites finish
- **Phase/Story**: Stage or user story from the spec (e.g., Stage0, FR-LD1)
- Include exact file paths or commands when modifying code or tooling

## Path Conventions
- VS Code extension client: `packages/extension/`
- Language server: `packages/server/`
- Shared utilities & domain: `packages/shared/`
- Scripts & CLIs: `scripts/`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/live-docs/`
- Staged Live Docs: `/.live-documentation/<baseLayer>/` (default `source/`, configurable via `liveDocumentation.root`)

## Stage 0 – Observe (Research & Baseline Validation)

**Purpose**: Capture current graph capabilities, confirm analyzer coverage, and design staging defaults before generating Live Docs.

- [x] LD-000 Research Windsurf Codemaps + GitLab Knowledge Graph behaviour, capture expectations in `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/research.md`
- [x] LD-001 Audit analyzer outputs for required symbol/dependency metadata, note coverage gaps in `AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/live-documentation-doc-refactor-plan.md`
- [x] LD-002 [P] Define Live Doc storage defaults (base layer defaults to `source/`) and configuration schema (`packages/shared/src/config/liveDocumentationConfig.ts`, backing interface + JSON schema)
- [x] LD-003 Prototype staged Live Doc folder under `/.live-documentation/<baseLayer>/` (default `source/`) with placeholder files illustrating authored vs generated sections
- [x] LD-004 [P] Capture regeneration latency baseline using existing safe-commit run; log benchmarks in `reports/benchmarks/live-docs/latency.md`
- [x] LD-005 Draft adoption playbook outline in `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/quickstart.md` describing Stage 0 review workflow

**Checkpoint**: Configuration shape, staging location, and baseline metrics agreed. No code writes to staged tree yet.

## Phase 1 – Schema & Instruction Harmonisation (FR-LD1, FR-LD11)

**Purpose**: Align instructions, roadmap, and falsifiability requirements so Live Docs have a canonical structure before tooling lands.

- [x] LD-100 Update Layer‑1/Layer‑2 MDMD to reference Live Documentation pillars and REQ-L acceptance criteria
- [x] LD-101 Refresh `.github/instructions/mdmd.layer4*.instructions.md` to mandate authored/generated split, relative links, and slug dialect enforcement
- [x] LD-102 [P] Define Live Doc front matter schema (`archetype`, `sourcePath`, `generatedAt`, provenance fields) in `packages/shared/src/live-docs/schema.ts`
- [x] LD-103 Extend falsifiability checklist (`specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/checklists/falsifiability.md`) with REQ-F1–REQ-F6 language referencing lint + regeneration proofs
- [x] LD-104 [P] Update Layer‑3 architecture docs to reflect Live Doc graph consumption (`.mdmd/layer-3/**/`)
- [x] LD-105 Draft Live Doc waiver policy in `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/checklists/evidence-waivers.md`

**Checkpoint**: Documentation stack consistently references Live Docs; schema + instructions unblock generator work.

## Phase 2 – Generator Foundations (FR-LD1, FR-LD2, FR-LD3)

**Purpose**: Build deterministic regeneration tooling that preserves authored content and stages generated sections with provenance metadata.

- [x] LD-200 Scaffold `npm run live-docs:generate` (entry under `scripts/live-docs/generate.ts`) reading config, walking tracked artifacts, and writing staged markdown
- [x] LD-201 Implement authored-block preservation and generated-block markers (`<!-- LIVE-DOC:BEGIN <section> -->`) with safety checks for missing markers
- [x] LD-202 [P] Emit core generated sections (Public Symbols, Dependencies) using existing analyzers; wire adapters in `packages/server/src/features/live-docs/generator.ts`
- [x] LD-203 [P] Record provenance metadata (analyzer id, hashes, benchmark versions) within generated blocks; add snapshot tests in `packages/shared/src/live-docs/generator.test.ts`
- [x] LD-204 [P] Stage output into `/.live-documentation/<baseLayer>/` (default `source/`); respect configurable root via workspace settings and CLI flag
- [x] LD-205 Add diff/dry-run mode so `npm run live-docs:generate -- --dry-run` surfaces changes without writing
- [x] LD-206 Create integration suite skeleton `tests/integration/live-docs/generation.test.ts` covering authored preservation and deterministic output
- [ ] LD-207 Establish language analyzer adapters for non-TypeScript fixtures so the generator emits `Public Symbols` and `Dependencies` for Python, C#, Java, Ruby, Rust, and C files using repository-hosted benchmark oracles (scope limited to fixtures tracked in this repo).
- [ ] LD-208 [P] Add integration coverage that runs `live-docs:generate` against the polyglot fixture workspaces and snapshots markdown output under `tests/integration/live-docs/polyglot-fixtures.test.ts`, ensuring regenerated docs stay deterministic before we target external repositories.

**Checkpoint**: Generator CLI produces deterministic staged Live Docs with provenance markers and dry-run diffing.

## Phase 3 – Evidence & Coverage Bridges (FR-LD2, FR-LD4)

**Purpose**: Populate evidence sections, enforce lint gates, and keep benchmarks in sync with generated markdown.

- [x] LD-300 Integrate coverage ingestion pipeline (`packages/server/src/features/live-docs/evidenceBridge.ts`) sourcing Vitest, pytest, dotnet, etc.
- [x] LD-301 [P] Surface `Observed Evidence`, `Targets`, `Supporting Fixtures` sections using coverage data; update generator templates accordingly
- [x] LD-302 Extend safe-commit to invoke Live Doc lint (`scripts/live-docs/lint.ts`) checking structure, evidence presence, and relative links
- [x] LD-303 [P] Update SlopCop rules to include staged Live Doc tree (`slopcop.config.json` adjustments + CLI docs)
- [x] LD-304 Author regression tests `tests/integration/live-docs/evidence.test.ts` verifying empty evidence triggers `_No automated evidence found_` and lint warnings
- [x] LD-305 Capture benchmark parity reports comparing analyzer outputs vs generated markdown (`reports/benchmarks/live-docs/precision.json`)

**Checkpoint**: Evidence sections flow end-to-end, lint gates enforce structure, and benchmarks quantify parity.

## Phase 4 – Consumption Surfaces & CLI Parity (FR-LD5, SC-LD4)

**Purpose**: Ensure diagnostics, CLI tooling, and Copilot prompts read from staged Live Docs while retaining legacy fallback during migration.

- [ ] LD-400 Pivot diagnostics publishers (`packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/*`) to resolve metadata from Live Docs, preserving legacy mode via feature flag
- [ ] LD-401 Update VS Code extension views/commands (`packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts`, `commands/exportDiagnostics.ts`) to embed Live Doc links + evidence counts
- [ ] LD-402 Ship CLI `scripts/live-docs/inspect.ts` mirroring UI output; add integration test `tests/integration/live-docs/inspect-cli.test.ts`
- [ ] LD-403 [P] Provide Copilot prompt helper referencing Live Docs (`packages/shared/src/live-docs/copilotContext.ts`)
- [ ] LD-404 Implement regeneration watcher so safe-commit or file save triggers targeted updates without full repo sweep
- [ ] LD-405 Document legacy-parity strategy in `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/quickstart.md` and Layer‑3 docs, including rollback toggles

**Checkpoint**: All consumption surfaces operate on Live Docs with documented parity against legacy graph outputs.

## Phase 5 – Docstring Bridges & Drift Enforcement (FR-LD6)

**Purpose**: Generate docstring bridge metadata, surface drift diagnostics, and expose sync workflows.

- [ ] LD-500 Emit docstring bridge config from generator (`scripts/live-docs/generate.ts` + `packages/shared/src/live-docs/docstringBridge.ts`)
- [ ] LD-501 Implement server-side bridge ingestion (`packages/server/src/features/live-docs/docstringService.ts`) tracking drift state
- [ ] LD-502 Publish drift diagnostics + CLI sync command (`packages/extension/src/commands/syncDocstrings.ts`, `scripts/live-docs/sync-docstrings.ts`)
- [ ] LD-503 [P] Add integration test `tests/integration/live-docs/docstring-drift.test.ts` covering positive/negative cases
- [ ] LD-504 Update falsifiability and waiver docs to include docstring drift escalation paths

**Checkpoint**: Docstring drift shows up in diagnostics/CLI, with waivers documented and tests capturing remediation flow.

## Phase 6 – Migration & Promotion (FR-LD7, FR-LD10)

**Purpose**: Promote staged Live Docs into canonical Layer‑4 docs, update configuration, and document rollback.

- [ ] LD-600 Build migration CLI (`scripts/live-docs/migrate.ts`) comparing staged tree to `.mdmd/layer-4/`
- [ ] LD-601 [P] Update Layer‑4 MDMD files to import generated blocks or point to Live Doc mirror once parity validated
- [ ] LD-602 Document migration procedure + rollback in `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/quickstart.md` and Layer‑1 adoption notes
- [ ] LD-603 Wire migration gate into safe-commit (block when parity reports fail)
- [ ] LD-604 Capture case-study log in `AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/live-documentation-migration-journal.md`

**Checkpoint**: Live Docs become canonical for opted-in repos; migration + rollback process reproducible.

## Phase 7 – Metadata Enrichers & Future Layers (FR-LD8, FR-LD9)

**Purpose**: Add optional enrichers, telemetry, and Layer‑2/Layer‑3 derivations.

- [ ] LD-700 Add co-activation analytics enricher sourced from deterministic Stage-0 signals (`packages/shared/src/live-docs/enrichers/coActivationEnricher.ts`, `referenceEnricher.ts`)
- [ ] LD-701 Extend telemetry to record regeneration latency, waiver counts, evidence coverage (updates in `packages/shared/src/telemetry/liveDocsTelemetry.ts`)
- [ ] LD-702 [P] Implement low-confidence edge tagging for external feeds + LLM augmentations with promotion workflow
- [ ] LD-703 Generate Layer‑2/Layer‑3 summaries from Live Docs (`scripts/live-docs/derive-roadmap.ts` producing `.mdmd/layer-2/` updates)
- [ ] LD-704 Add audit dashboard export CLI (`scripts/live-docs/report.ts`) summarising SC-LD metrics
- [ ] LD-705 Define deterministic derivation rules for System Layer archetypes using Layer‑4 graph data; document expected outputs in `AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/live-documentation-doc-refactor-plan.md` (see System Layer Signal Catalog) with legacy `.mdmd/layer-3/**` docs serving only as validation references
- [ ] LD-706 Stand up System Layer mirror under `/.live-documentation/system/` with seeded docs preserving authored `Purpose`/`Notes`
- [ ] LD-707 Extend generator to populate System Layer `Components` lists and Mermaid `Topology` diagrams (with `click` links) from Layer‑4 dependency data
- [ ] LD-708 Wire live-docs:lint/SlopCop rules enforcing System Layer structure (required generated sections, no direct Layer‑4 links outside `Components`)
- [ ] LD-709 Validate System Layer renders across VS Code preview, CLI `live-docs inspect`, and markdown export, then schedule MDMD Layer‑3 retirement window
- [ ] LD-710 Parse workflow orchestrators (e.g., `scripts/live-docs/run-all.ts`) to extract stage ordering when dependencies are expressed via string literals rather than imports
- [ ] LD-711 Hook System Layer derivation into coverage manifests (`coverage/live-docs/targets.json`) once emitted so testing archetypes reflect bidirectional coverage data
- [x] LD-712 Refactor `packages/server/src/features/live-docs/generator.ts` to extract shared core utilities (target discovery, analysis, merge/write pipeline) into a reusable module under `packages/server/src/features/live-docs/core`. *(Shared helpers emitted in `packages/server/src/features/live-docs/generation/core.ts`; `generator.ts` now consumes them.)*
- [ ] LD-713 Create layer-specific generator entrypoints (`generator.layer4.ts`, `generator.system.ts`) that compose the shared core with layer rules while keeping existing CLI integrations functional
- [ ] LD-714 Filter build artefacts (e.g., compiled `.js` siblings) out of System Layer `Components` while preserving canonical TypeScript sources.
- [ ] LD-715 Merge duplicate System Layer interaction/workflow docs when they describe the same orchestrator; ensure topology reflects single-source ordering.
- [ ] LD-716 Enrich System Layer topology with orchestrator stage edges emitted from LD-710 so CLI interaction docs show meaningful flow instead of isolated nodes.
- [ ] LD-717 Prune and aggregate testing archetype topology to highlight Live Docs suites while avoiding unreadable graphs (e.g., collapse extension diagnostics tests).
- [ ] LD-718 Ship `npm run live-docs:system` CLI that emits System analytics as on-demand materialized views (stdout or caller-provided temp directory) with markdown/JSON format options.
- [ ] LD-719 Remove the committed `.live-documentation/system/` mirror once the CLI is validated, updating lint/safe-commit rules to block future check-ins of materialized views.
- [ ] LD-720 Author integration tests and fixture workspaces that exercise the System analytics CLI against known technical debt so failures surface without persisting docs.

**Checkpoint**: Live Docs feed richer telemetry and derived docs without sacrificing determinism.

## Stage 8 – Layer Distribution & External Surfaces

**Purpose**: Place each MDMD layer with the platform best suited for it while Live Documentation focuses on Implementation + analytics.

- [ ] LD-800 Scaffolding task: generate a GitHub Pages (or equivalent) site sourced from Layer‑1 vision content, including build script and publish workflow.
- [ ] LD-801 Define integration pattern for Layer‑2 commitments via Spec-Kit and external issue trackers, adding cross-links from Live Docs to canonical work items.
- [ ] LD-802 Update onboarding/quickstart docs to explain the layered artifact distribution and reference the System analytics CLI as the source of materialized views.

**Checkpoint**: Documentation layers are mapped to their long-term homes, and Live Docs tooling references them accordingly.

## Stage Dependencies & Parallelism

- **Stage0 → Phase1**: Complete research + configuration decisions before finalising schema.
- **Phase1 → Phase2**: Generator work blocks on schema + instructions.
- **Phase2 → Phase3**: Evidence pipeline relies on generator scaffolding.
- **Phase3 → Phase4**: Consumption surfaces switch once evidence + lint gates active.
- **Phase4 → Phase5**: Docstring drift requires Live Docs as source of truth.
- **Phase5 → Phase6**: Migration waits for drift tools to avoid regressions.
- **Phase6 → Phase7**: Enrichers build on canonical Live Docs.

Tasks tagged `[P]` can run concurrently when dependencies agree (e.g., LD-202/203, LD-302/303). Evidence and consumption phases split across teams by surface (CLI vs diagnostics) once generator stabilises.

## Implementation Traceability
- Generator + bridges live under `packages/server/src/features/live-docs/` and `packages/shared/src/live-docs/`
- CLI tooling resides in `scripts/live-docs/`
- Integration suites materialise under `tests/integration/live-docs/`
- Documentation updates land across `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/**` and `.mdmd/layer-*/`
