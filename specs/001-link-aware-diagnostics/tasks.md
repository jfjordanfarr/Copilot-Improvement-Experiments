---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Developers see code-change impact (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Raise diagnostics on every code artifact impacted by a change so engineers know the full ripple before merging

**Independent Test**: Editing a code file in a benchmark workspace triggers diagnostics on all dependent modules without relying on documentation features

- [x] T034 [P] [US1] Add integration test `tests/integration/us1/codeImpact.test.ts` covering code-change diagnostics, debounce behaviour, and dependency surfacing (with and without AST fixtures)

- [x] T041 [US1] Implement LLM-assisted ripple analysis for cross-artifact watchers in `packages/server/src/features/knowledge/rippleAnalyzer.ts`

**Checkpoint**: Code-change impact is fully functional and independently testable

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Writers get drift alerts (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Warn writers when documentation changes require code or downstream document review, powered by the shared dependency graph

**Independent Test**: Saving a mapped markdown file raises diagnostics on linked implementation files without US3 features

- [x] T026 [P] [US2] Add integration test `tests/integration/us2/markdownDrift.test.ts` covering markdown edits, debounce behaviour, and diagnostic publication

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T027 [US2] Implement link override command in `packages/extension/src/commands/overrideLink.ts`
- [x] T028 [P] [US2] Build link inference orchestrator in `packages/shared/src/inference/linkInference.ts` that consumes symbol/reference providers and knowledge-graph feeds
- [x] T029 [US2] Implement markdown save watcher in `packages/server/src/features/watchers/markdownWatcher.ts`
- [x] T030 [US2] Persist documentation change events in `packages/server/src/features/changeEvents/saveDocumentChange.ts`

- [x] T033 [US2] Implement hysteresis controller in `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/hysteresisController.ts` to suppress reciprocal diagnostics until acknowledgement

**Checkpoint**: Documentation drift diagnostics operate on top of the unified graph

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Leads resolve alerts efficiently (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide acknowledgement workflows and consolidated views so leads can manage drift signals

**Independent Test**: Acknowledging diagnostics clears them until new changes and exports summaries without relying on prior stories

- [x] T042 [P] [US3] Add integration test `tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts` covering acknowledgement flow, hysteresis release, and settings overrides

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T043 [US3] Implement acknowledgement service with SQLite persistence and settings awareness in `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/acknowledgementService.ts`
- [x] T044 [P] [US3] Create diagnostics tree view provider in `packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts`
- [x] T045 [US3] Implement export diagnostics command in `packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts`
- [ ] T046 [US3] Add configurable noise suppression filters in `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/noiseFilter.ts`

- [ ] T059 [US3] Persist drift history log entries in `packages/server/src/telemetry/driftHistoryStore.ts` and expose summary reporting demanded by FR-009

**Checkpoint**: All user stories independently functional with full workflow coverage

---

- [ ] T049 [P] Add CI script `ci-check` to root `package.json` invoking headless validation
- [ ] T050 [P] Document constitution alignment, consent controls, and configuration guidance in `README.md`
- [ ] T051 Execute full regression suite via `tests/integration/` runner and record results in `docs/test-report.md`
- [ ] T052 Instrument diagnostic latency telemetry in `packages/server/src/telemetry/latencyTracker.ts`
- [ ] T053 [P] Add performance validation test `tests/integration/perf/diagnosticLatency.test.ts`
- [ ] T057 Establish benchmark workspace automation in `tests/integration/benchmarks/rebuildStability.test.ts` measuring link graph reproducibility
- [ ] T058 [P] Capture inference accuracy metrics and reporting pipeline in `packages/server/src/telemetry/inferenceAccuracy.ts`
- [ ] T060 Curate AST-backed benchmark repos (starting with C and at least one additional language) under `tests/integration/benchmarks/ast-fixtures/`
- [ ] T061 Implement AST comparison harness in `tests/integration/benchmarks/astAccuracy.test.ts` that reconciles inferred graphs with canonical ASTs
- [ ] T062 Integrate dual-mode benchmark selection (AST vs self-similarity) into CI via root `package.json` scripts and `npm run ci-check`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies
- **Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2**: Setup must complete before foundational work
- **Phase 2 â†’ Phases 3-5**: Foundational tasks (including configuration, watcher plumbing, hysteresis scaffolding) block all user stories
- **Phase 3 â†’ Phase 4 â†’ Phase 5**: Stories prioritized P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3; later stories can start once foundational is done but should respect priority unless staffing allows parallel execution
- **Phase 6**: Runs after desired user stories are complete

### User Story Dependencies
- **US1**: Depends only on Phase 2 completion
- **US2**: Depends on Phase 2; enriches but does not strictly depend on US1 implementations
- **US3**: Depends on Phase 2; consumes diagnostics produced by earlier stories but can be developed independently using seeded data

### Task Dependencies (Highlights)
- T031 depends on T027â€“T030
- T033 depends on T043 (acknowledgement state definitions) and T017 (settings propagation)
- T038 depends on T035â€“T037
- T041 depends on T017â€“T019 and T025
- T056 depends on T055 and T025
- T052 depends on T022 and T038
- T057 depends on T054, T028, and T058

## Parallel Opportunities
- Marked `[P]` tasks across phases (e.g., T003, T004, T006, T008, T011, T013, T015, T017, T020, T024, T028, T032, T034, T036, T039, T044, T047, T049, T050, T053, T055, T058) can proceed concurrently once prerequisites finish
- Different user stories can be staffed in parallel after Phase 2, with coordination to avoid file conflicts
- Within each story, tests (T022, T030, T036) can be drafted while implementation scaffolding proceeds

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1)
1. Complete Phases 1 and 2
2. Deliver Phase 3 (US1) and validate via T022
3. Ship MVP to pilot teams for early feedback

### Incremental Delivery
1. Extend MVP with Phase 4 (US2) diagnostics for developers
2. Add Phase 5 (US3) management workflows when teams are ready for operational tracking
3. Finish with Phase 6 polish before broader rollout, including telemetry and performance validation

### Parallel Team Strategy
- Engineer A: Leads Phase 2 data store, configuration plumbing, and server backbone (T005â€“T021)
- Engineer B: Drives US1 implementation (T022â€“T029)
- Engineer C: Builds US2 dependency intelligence (T030â€“T035)
- Engineer D: Owns US3 acknowledgement tooling and AI opt-in (T036â€“T041)
- Shared effort: Polish tasks and instrumentation (T042â€“T047)
