# Implementation Plan: Live Documentation

**Branch**: `001-live-documentation` | **Date**: 2025-10-16 (pivoted 2025-11-08) | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Deliver a reproducible Live Documentation system where every tracked workspace asset has a paired markdown file containing an authored preamble and generated sections (`Public Symbols`, `Dependencies`, archetype metadata). The VS Code extension watches file saves, runs analyzers to refresh generated sections into a mirror tree under `/.live-documentation/<baseLayer>/` (default `source/`, user configurable), and enforces structure via lint gates embedded in `npm run safe:commit`. Generated blocks are owned by tooling while humans curate small authored notes, keeping the corpus reviewable and diff-friendly. Deterministic benchmarks, coverage feeds, and docstring bridges back the generated data so diagnostics, CLI exports, and LLM consumers rely on the same markdown-as-AST graph. The plan stages the migration from existing Layer‑4 MDMD docs to generated Live Documentation, maintains polyglot analyzer fidelity, and graduates into feature-flagged authoring loops where markdown edits safely round-trip into docstrings and optional scaffolds.

## Adoption Strategy
- **Stage 0 – Observe**: Generate Live Documentation into `/.live-documentation/<baseLayer>/` (default `source/`) without replacing MDMD; provide read-only viewers and diff tooling so contributors assess fidelity.
- **Stage 1 – Guard**: Enable lint warnings for structural drift, missing evidence, or stale generated sections; enforce workspace-relative link hygiene and configurable slug dialects for wiki publishing.
- **Stage 2 – Bridge**: Activate docstring and coverage bridges, wire diagnostics/CLI exports to Live Documentation, and require explicit acknowledgements or waivers when evidence is absent.
- **Stage 3 – Sustain**: Treat generated Live Documentation as canonical, flip configuration so Layer‑4 MDMD mirrors the staged tree, and block merges unless regeneration and lint gates pass.
- **Stage 4 – Author**: Introduce opt-in bidirectional authoring commands that preview markdown → docstring diffs, capture audit trails, and emit scratch scaffolds without touching tracked files until humans promote them.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x targeting Node.js 22 for extension + LSP, SQL schema for SQLite 3  
**Primary Dependencies**: VS Code Extension API, `vscode-languageclient`/`vscode-languageserver`, `better-sqlite3`, existing language analyzers/heuristics, coverage ingestion utilities, optional LLM access via `vscode.lm` (guard-railed)  
**Storage**: Embedded SQLite property graph for analyzer outputs & coverage signals; generated markdown stored under configurable `liveDocumentation.root`  
**Testing**: `vitest` for analyzers/tooling, `@vscode/test-electron` integration suites, benchmark harnesses under `reports/benchmarks`, Live Doc regeneration snapshot tests  
**Target Platform**: VS Code desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) with optional headless language server for CI regeneration  
**Project Type**: Multi-package workspace (`packages/extension`, `packages/server`, `packages/shared`) plus supporting scripts under `scripts/`  
**Performance Goals**: Regenerate affected Live Docs within a single `safe:commit` run (<30s for 5k-file repo); CLI/diagnostics respond ≤2s using cached markdown graph  
**Constraints**: Operate offline by default, keep generated blocks deterministic, use workspace-relative links, maintain polyglot analyzer precision (≥0.9 symbols, ≥0.8 dependencies), expose CLI parity for every UI affordance  
**Scale/Scope**: Pilot repos up to 1M LOC with polyglot stacks (TS, Python, Rust, Java, Ruby, C, C#) and binary assets referenced via markdown links

## Constitution Check

Constitution v1.0.0 principles remain satisfied. Live Documentation strengthens Documentation-Implementation Unity and Tooling Reuse while operating under Responsible Intelligence (optional LLM enrichment stays opt-in). No waivers required.

```

**Structure Decision**: Preserve the multi-package setup but introduce dedicated Live Docs tooling under `scripts/live-docs` and integration suites mirroring staged outputs. The staged `/live-documentation/` directory remains untracked until migration gates pass.

## Complexity Tracking

TBD — populate if future scope deviates from Constitution constraints.

## Phases & Key Deliverables

### Phase 0 – Research & Competitive Analysis
- Document Windsurf Codemaps and GitLab Knowledge Graph capabilities; extract UX expectations (shareable maps, CLI/agent surfaces) into requirements.
- Audit existing analyzers/benchmarks to confirm they emit symbol + dependency data required for generated sections; note coverage gaps.
- Decide Live Doc storage defaults, configuration shape (`liveDocumentation.root`, slug dialect), and migration toggles.

### Phase 1 – Schema & Instruction Harmonisation
- Finalize Layer‑4 instructions (base + archetype overlays) and align Layer‑1/Layer‑2 docs with LDG pillars.
- Design Live Doc metadata schema (authored sections, generated markers, provenance, Live Doc ID, waiver annotations).
- Update falsifiability requirements (REQ-F1–REQ-F6) to cover structural lint, deterministic regeneration, relative-link enforcement, and docstring drift.

### Phase 2 – Generator Foundations
- Implement `npm run live-docs:generate` command that reads configuration, preserves authored blocks, and emits generated sections with HTML markers.
- Introduce deterministic hashing + provenance metadata inside each generated block.
- Stage output into `/.live-documentation/<baseLayer>/` (default `source/`) with diff tooling comparing current MDMD files.
- Update SlopCop rules and safe-commit pipeline to lint staged Live Docs for structure and relative-link hygiene.

### Phase 3 – Evidence & Coverage Bridges
- Wire coverage ingestion (unit, integration, benchmark) to populate `Observed Evidence`, `Targets`, and `Supporting Fixtures` sections.
- Validate `Observed Evidence` blocks when emitted and ensure waiver markers surface only when automated evidence is absent. *(live-docs:lint now skips files with no evidence data but still enforces waiver markup when the section appears.)*
- Extend benchmarks to confirm polyglot analyzers maintain ≥0.9/≥0.8 precision/recall after bridge integration. *(live-docs:report enforces thresholds and runs inside the safe-to-commit pipeline.)*

### Phase 4 – Consumption Surfaces & CLI Parity
- Pivot diagnostics, tree views, and quick pick commands to read from staged Live Docs.
- Ship CLI counterparts (`live-docs inspect`, `live-docs evidence`, etc.) delivering equivalent data for LLM automation.
- Provide diff and dry-run modes to review regeneration impacts before applying.

### Phase 5 – Docstring Bridges & Bidirectional Authoring
- Emit docstring bridge configuration from Live Documentation, implement server-side reconciliation, and surface drift diagnostics with actionable remediation hints.
- Build preview/apply workflows (CLI + VS Code) that diff authored markdown against inline docstrings, require explicit confirmation, and record provenance (`actor`, `timestamp`, `target symbols`).
- Introduce workspace feature flags and telemetry sinks so teams can trial bidirectional authoring without destabilising regeneration, capturing success/failure metrics for every attempt.
- Harden polyglot fixtures (C#, Java, TypeScript, Python) with HTML-rich, multi-paragraph docstrings to validate sanitisation, canonical tagging, and lossless round trips.
- Prototype generative scaffolding commands that materialise scratch pseudocode or language-specific skeletons tied back to the originating Live Documentation file.

### Phase 6 – Migration & Promotion
- Produce migration CLI (`live-docs migrate`) that copies staged Live Docs into the MDMD Layer‑4 tree once parity metrics pass.
- Update Layer‑3 architecture docs and knowledge feeds to consume the new markdown graph.
- Flip default configuration for repositories that opt in; document rollback strategy.

### Phase 7 – Metadata Enrichers & Future Layers
- Add optional generated analytics (deterministic co-activation scores, reference counts) guarded by reproducible inputs.
- Prototype Layer‑3/Layer‑2 Live Documentation derived from aggregated Layer‑4 data (release-level docs, work-item mapping) while preserving authored/generated pattern.
- Explore visual exports (mermaid diagrams, shareable codemaps) grounded in the markdown graph.

#### System Layer Migration Checklist
- [ ] Iterate on first-pass System Layer output: filter build artefacts (e.g., `.js` siblings) from `Components`, collapse duplicate interaction/workflow docs, enrich topology edges for CLI orchestration, and trim coverage graphs to Live Docs suites.
- [ ] Introduce layer-specific generators (`generator.layer4.ts`, `generator.system.ts`) that compose the shared foundation with archetype derivation rules, keeping the existing CLI entrypoints compatible.

## Implementation Traceability
- [`packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts`](../../packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts) orchestrates analyzer execution feeding Live Doc regeneration.
- [`packages/shared/src/tooling/documentationLinks.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/tooling/documentationLinks.ts) and upcoming `liveDocumentationGenerator` module emit staged markdown.
- [`packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts`](../../packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts) and planned `live-docs` CLI provide human/LLM consumption surfaces.
- Integration suites under `tests/integration/live-docs` validate regeneration, evidence mapping, and docstring drift; benchmark harnesses in `reports/benchmarks` ensure analyzer accuracy remains above target.
