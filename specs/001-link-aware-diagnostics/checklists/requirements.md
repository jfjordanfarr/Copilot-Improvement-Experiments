# Specification Quality Checklist: Live Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate Live Documentation specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning.
**Created**: 2025-10-16 (pivoted 2025-11-08)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (Vision, User Stories, Edge Cases, Success Criteria)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined and reference Live Documentation workflows (regeneration, evidence, consumption)
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria mapped to FR-LD# identifiers
- [x] User scenarios cover authored curation, generated synchronization, consumption, and evidence enforcement
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (SC-LD#)
- [x] Implementation guidance stays at workflow level (tooling specifics remain in plan/tasks)

## Live Documentation Guardrails

- [x] Specification mandates authored vs generated separation with HTML markers
- [x] Specification requires deterministic regeneration with analyzer provenance metadata
- [x] Evidence expectations (tests, waivers, diagnostics) are documented
- [x] Relative markdown links and configurable slug dialect called out for wiki portability
- [x] CLI/LLM parity captured as requirement for all user-facing interactions

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Implementation Traceability
- [`packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts`](/packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts) and [`packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts`](/packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts) demonstrate Live Doc consumption surfaces validated by this checklist.
- [`packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts`](/packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts) and the forthcoming `packages/server/src/features/live-docs/generator.ts` operationalise analyzer-to-Doc flows under review.
- Upcoming integration suites under `tests/integration/live-docs/` (generation, evidence, docstring drift) will provide falsifiability coverage tied back to these requirements.
