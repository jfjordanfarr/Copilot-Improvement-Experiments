# Specification Quality Checklist: Link-Aware Diagnostics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Implementation Traceability
- [`packages/extension/src/diagnostics/docDiagnosticProvider.ts`](/packages/extension/src/diagnostics/docDiagnosticProvider.ts) and [`dependencyQuickPick.ts`](/packages/extension/src/diagnostics/dependencyQuickPick.ts) reflect the user-facing behaviours this checklist validates.
- [`packages/server/src/main.ts`](/packages/server/src/main.ts) and [`packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts`](/packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts) operationalise the specification flows under review.
- [`tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts`](/tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts) and [`tests/integration/us4/scopeCollision.test.ts`](/tests/integration/us4/scopeCollision.test.ts) provide falsifiability coverage tied back to these requirements.
