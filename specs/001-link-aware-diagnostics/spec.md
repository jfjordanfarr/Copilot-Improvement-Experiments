# Feature Specification: Live Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `001-live-documentation`

**Created**: 2025-10-16 (pivoted 2025-11-08)

**Status**: In Progress

**Input**: "Deliver an open-source, markdown-as-AST system where every workspace artifact has Live Documentation: an authored preamble plus generated sections describing programmatic surface, dependencies, and evidence, powering diagnostics and copilots without cloud dependencies."

**Current Vision**: Live Documentation mirrors each tracked asset under `/.live-documentation/source/`, giving it an authored preamble plus deterministic generated metadata. Diagnostics, CLI exports, and copilots consume the same markdown graph, while System-level views (clusters, workflows, coverage rollups) are generated on demand instead of being committed to the repository, keeping the experience reproducible and ephemeral by design. Layer 1 capabilities publish to a static site (initially GitHub Pages), Layer 2 requirements reconcile with Spec-Kit and issue trackers, and the System CLI streams materialized views so no architecture markdown lingers in the repo.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 – Authors curate Live Documentation headers (Priority: P1)

**Status**: In progress — validated by instruction updates and upcoming integration suites under `tests/integration/live-docs`.

Maintainers open a Live Doc, edit the authored `Description`, `Purpose`, or `Notes`, and regenerate generated sections without losing manual context. The mirror tree lives under `/.live-documentation/` by default but can be reconfigured.

**Why this priority**: The authored preamble communicates intent; losing it would make Live Docs untrustworthy even if generated metadata is correct. Authors need deterministic tooling to preserve their work.

**Independent Test**: Start from a staged Live Doc, modify the authored `Notes`, run the regeneration command, and confirm generated blocks update while authored content remains untouched.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Live Doc with authored notes, **When** the maintainer runs `npm run live-docs:generate`, **Then** generated sections refresh while authored markdown is unchanged byte-for-byte.
2. **Given** a Live Doc stored outside the repository (custom path), **When** regeneration runs, **Then** the output path honours configuration and maintains mirror structure.
3. **Given** an attempt to remove the `Metadata` or `Authored` headings, **When** safe-commit executes, **Then** lint fails with actionable guidance.

### User Story 2 – Generated sections stay in sync (Priority: P1)

**Status**: In progress — benchmarks and regeneration CLIs exist; evidence feeds still pending.

Developers run regeneration or save a file; the Live Doc generator updates `Public Symbols`, `Dependencies`, and archetype-specific sections (`Observed Evidence`, `Targets`, `Consumers`) deterministically using analyzers and coverage feeds.

**Why this priority**: Live Docs only replace ad-hoc wiki pages if their generated content stays accurate and auditable.

**Independent Test**: Modify a code file’s exports, regenerate Live Docs, and verify the corresponding `Public Symbols` section reflects the change with correct provenance metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a TypeScript module with new exports, **When** regeneration runs, **Then** the Live Doc lists the new symbol with docstring summary and source anchor.
2. **Given** an HTML template referencing an image, **When** regeneration runs, **Then** the asset Live Doc lists the template under `Consumers`.
3. **Given** a test covering multiple implementations, **When** regeneration runs, **Then** the test Live Doc lists all targets; removing a target triggers a diff and lint warning.

---

### User Story 3 – Teams consume Live Doc intelligence on demand (Priority: P2)

**Status**: Planned — existing diagnostics and CLI outputs will pivot to Live Docs and stream System analytics without persisting new docs.

Leads export impact reports, Copilot prompts, or diagnostics sourced from the Live Doc graph, seeing the same metadata (generated timestamp, evidence count, dependency depth) regardless of surface. System-level analytics (clusters, workflows, coverage gaps) remain ephemeral views that can be regenerated whenever needed.

**Why this priority**: Consumption surfaces prove the system’s value; without them Live Docs become a static archive.

**Independent Test**: Generate Live Docs, run the diagnostics provider and CLI export, and confirm both render consistent data for a given file change while leaving the workspace clean.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer saving a file, **When** diagnostics appear, **Then** entries include links to the relevant Live Docs with evidence counts.
2. **Given** a CLI command `live-docs inspect packages/.../file.ts`, **When** executed, **Then** it renders markdown summarising public symbols, dependencies, and evidence identical to the Live Doc file.
3. **Given** a CLI command `live-docs system --cluster <id>`, **When** executed, **Then** it streams the analytics to stdout (or a temp file when requested) and leaves `.live-documentation/system/` unchanged.

---

### User Story 4 – Evidence gaps trigger escalation (Priority: P3)

**Status**: Planned — depends on coverage ingestion.

Teams rely on Live Docs to surface missing test coverage. When evidence sections are empty without waivers, lint and diagnostics escalate the gap.

**Why this priority**: Evidence transforms Live Docs from documentation into an accountability tool.

**Independent Test**: Remove tests covering a module, regenerate Live Docs, and check that lint warnings and diagnostics point to the missing evidence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an implementation Live Doc without tests, **When** regeneration runs, **Then** the Evidence section reads `_No automated evidence found_` and safe-commit fails unless a waiver exists.
2. **Given** a waiver comment, **When** lint runs, **Then** it passes while logging the waiver for dashboards.
3. **Given** new tests added, **When** regeneration reruns, **Then** the Evidence section lists the tests and the warning clears automatically.

---

### User Story 5 – Legacy graph workflows remain accessible (Priority: P3)

**Status**: Sunset planning — ensures current users retain value during migration.

Early adopters using change-impact diagnostics and symbol neighborhood tooling continue to receive signals until Live Docs fully replace old surfaces.

**Independent Test**: Run both the legacy diagnostics suite and Live Doc-backed suite in parallel, verifying consistency and measuring deltas.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a code edit, **When** both pipelines run, **Then** diagnostics produced from the graph and Live Docs agree on impacted artifacts.
2. **Given** a symbol neighbourhood query, **When** executed, **Then** results include backlinks to Live Docs for each node.
3. **Given** a regression in Live Doc generation, **When** safe-commit runs, **Then** the legacy pipeline remains available while regeneration issues are resolved.

---

### User Story 6 – Layer distribution surfaces (Priority: P2)

**Status**: Planned — aligns public site publishing, requirement delegation, and on-demand analytics.

Stakeholders expect Layer 1 vision pages to publish externally without manual cloning, Layer 2 requirements to reconcile with Spec-Kit or issue trackers, and System analytics to remain ephemeral CLI outputs that highlight debt without polluting the repo.

**Why this priority**: The documentation stack only scales if each layer lives where people expect to consume it; failing to publish Layer 1 or to reconcile Layer 2 with execution tools would fragment the workflow.

**Independent Test**: Run the static site build, Spec-Kit sync, and System CLI against a sample workspace; confirm the site renders cleanly, requirement checklists match external state, and the CLI surfaces architectural hotspots without leaving tracked files behind.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the Layer 1 markdown corpus, **When** the static site workflow runs, **Then** it publishes updated pages with no broken links or missing capabilities.
2. **Given** a Layer 2 requirement linked to Spec-Kit tasks, **When** safe-commit executes, **Then** mismatches between markdown checkboxes and Spec-Kit state appear in the generated snapshot with actionable diffs.
3. **Given** the `npm run live-docs:system` command, **When** it targets an intentionally messy fixture, **Then** the CLI output flags the architectural debt and the `.live-documentation/system/` directory remains empty unless a deliberate export flag is provided.

### Edge Cases

- Newly created files without exports still receive stub Live Docs; generated sections display `_No data available_` until analyzers detect symbols.
- Live Docs remain stable when files move or are renamed; migration scripts update metadata and code path references automatically.
- Rapid edits triggering regeneration multiple times must coalesce; generated blocks should only change when analyzer output differs.
- Tests spanning many implementations should not bloat Implementation Live Docs; backlinks flow through the graph instead of duplicating content.
- External feeds (GitLab Knowledge Graph, LSIF) failing mid-run must not overwrite existing generated sections; provenance markers flag stale data.
- LLM augmentations must remain opt-in and clearly labeled to prevent unverifiable edges sneaking into generated content.
- Safe-commit must continue to run offline; Live Doc regeneration cannot require cloud calls for deterministic builds.
- System analytics should never leave behind tracked files by default; generators must clean up temporary exports even when commands error.
- Static site publishing and Spec-Kit syncing remain optional per workspace but default on for project-owned repos so stakeholders have a consistent entry point.

### Live Doc Generation Lifecycle

1. **Staging**: Regeneration writes output to `/.live-documentation/` (or configured path), preserving authored sections and updating generated blocks.
2. **Validation**: Safe-commit runs structural lint, analyzer parity checks, and evidence completeness audits before allowing merges.
3. **Promotion**: Once parity with existing MDMD Layer‑4 docs is proven, configuration flips to treat Live Docs as canonical; legacy docs become generated outputs as well.
4. **Consumption**: Diagnostics, CLI, and Copilot exports read directly from Live Docs, while System analytics regenerate materialized views on demand (streamed to stdout or temp files) so no stale architecture docs linger in the repo.

### Cache Retention & Privacy

Live Docs live alongside the repository (versionable or ignored per configuration). Analyzer caches remain disposable; whenever they regenerate, markup updates deterministically. External adopters can regenerate from scratch without shipping proprietary data.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-LD1**: Generator MUST create/refresh Live Docs under a configurable root (default `/.live-documentation/`), preserving authored sections and updating generated sections with deterministic output guarded by HTML markers.
- **FR-LD2**: Generator MUST emit `Public Symbols`, `Dependencies`, and archetype-specific sections (Implementation: `Observed Evidence`; Test: `Targets`, `Supporting Fixtures`; Asset: `Consumers`) using analyzer output and coverage data.
- **FR-LD3**: Regeneration MUST record provenance metadata (analyzer id, timestamp, benchmark hash) within generated blocks for auditability.
- **FR-LD4**: Safe-commit pipeline MUST lint Live Docs for structural completeness, analyzer parity, and evidence presence, failing merges when violations occur unless explicit waivers are present.
- **FR-LD5**: Diagnostics, CLI, and Copilot surfaces MUST consume Live Docs as their single source of truth, embedding links back to the originating documents.
- **FR-LD6**: Docstring bridges MUST reconcile inline documentation with Live Doc summaries, raising drift diagnostics when mismatches persist beyond one regeneration cycle.
- **FR-LD7**: Migration tooling MUST compare existing Layer‑4 MDMD docs to generated Live Docs, producing diff reports and updating references (Layer‑3/Layer‑1) once parity is confirmed.
- **FR-LD8**: External feeds (LSIF, SCIP, GitLab Knowledge Graph) and optional LLM augmentations MUST tag generated sections with confidence tiers; low-confidence edges require manual promotion before appearing in diagnostics.
- **FR-LD9**: Telemetry MUST report regeneration latency, evidence coverage rates, and waiver counts to evaluate adoption.
- **FR-LD10**: Live Doc configuration MUST expose glob patterns, archetype overrides, and storage paths while remaining version-controlled and documented for adopters.
- **FR-LD11**: Generated Live Docs MUST emit workspace-relative markdown links and enforce header slugs according to the configured dialect (GitHub default); violations require explicit waivers surfaced in lint.
- **FR-LD12**: System analytics MUST default to ephemeral outputs (stdout or temporary directories) and require explicit user confirmation before writing tracked files; commands MUST tag persisted exports so lint can detect strays.
- **FR-LD13**: Layer distribution tooling MUST publish Layer 1 capabilities via a scripted static site, reconcile Layer 2 requirement status with Spec-Kit/issue trackers, and keep System analytics as CLI materialized views that leave no tracked artefacts unless explicitly promoted.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Live Doc Artifact**: Markdown file containing Metadata, Authored, and Generated sections for a single source asset; stores archetype, timestamps, and provenance summary.
- **Analyzer Output**: Structured description of symbols, dependencies, and coverage emitted by tooling; includes hash for determinism checks.
- **Evidence Item**: Test case, benchmark, or manual review that exercises or validates an implementation artifact; includes status, location, and waiver metadata.
- **Waiver Record**: Justification for temporarily accepting missing evidence; references owning team, expiry date, and follow-up task id.
- **Consumption Surface**: Diagnostics, CLI, Copilot prompt, or report derived from Live Docs; records render latency and Live Doc version used.

## Assumptions

- Existing MDMD Layer‑4 docs remain authoritative until Live Docs pass acceptance benchmarks; migrations occur file-by-file with human review.
- Regeneration runs locally without requiring internet access; optional LLM enrichments stay opt-in.
- Analyzer plugins can be authored in TypeScript and executed within the server; polyglot coverage is staged via CLI bridges until native analyzers land.
- Teams tolerate short regeneration windows (≤30 s for 5k-file repo) during safe-commit; tooling will parallelise to stay within bounds.
- Documentation writers will adopt the authored header schema once editors expose helpers or snippets.
- External adopters expect MIT-licensed tooling and CLI-first workflows; Live Docs must regenerate without VS Code to broaden reach.
- System analytics remain ephemeral unless a user explicitly persists them; tooling should assume a clean workspace between runs.
- Static site publishing and Spec-Kit syncing remain optional per workspace but default on for project-owned repos so stakeholders have a consistent entry point.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-LD1**: ≥95% of modified source files have Live Docs regenerated within a single `safe:commit` run; structural lint reports zero missing sections.
- **SC-LD2**: Analyzer precision/recall stays ≥0.9 for exported symbols and ≥0.8 for dependencies across supported languages, as reported by benchmarks.
- **SC-LD3**: 100% of implementation Live Docs list evidence or waivers; unresolved gaps trigger lint warnings within 24 hours.
- **SC-LD4**: Diagnostics and CLI exports referencing Live Docs respond within ≤2 s for repositories under 10k files.
- **SC-LD5**: External adopters regenerate Live Docs from scratch using documented commands, pass safe-commit, and report successful onboarding within one day.
- **SC-LD6**: Docstring drift diagnostics resolve within one regeneration cycle during integration tests, with zero lingering violations after safe-commit.
- **SC-LD7**: Relative-link lint reports zero violations after regeneration, and exported Live Docs render without broken anchors when served from a static wiki path.
- **SC-LD8**: System analytics commands leave no tracked artefacts by default and finish within ≤2 s for repositories under 10k files when streaming to stdout.
- **SC-LD9**: Static site builds publish Layer 1 capabilities without broken links, Layer 2 requirements stay in sync with Spec-Kit/issue trackers, and the System CLI surfaces architectural debt while keeping the tracked tree clean between runs.


## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-08

- Q: How are authored sections protected during regeneration? → A: HTML markers wrap each generated block; the generator rewrites only the content between markers and fails if markers are missing.
- Q: Where does evidence data originate? → A: Coverage ingestion pipeline scrapes test metadata (`vitest`, `pytest`, `dotnet test`) and manual audit manifests; missing data defaults to `_No automated evidence found_` with required waiver.
- Q: How do legacy diagnostics coexist with Live Docs? → A: Safe-commit runs both pipelines until Live Docs achieve parity; feature flags determine the active surface per workspace.
