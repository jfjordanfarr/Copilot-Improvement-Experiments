# Copilot Instructions

Last updated: 2025-10-19

## Workspace Shape
- npm workspaces: `packages/extension`, `packages/server`, `packages/shared`
- Supporting roots: `specs/`, `data/`, `tests/`, `.specify/`
- TypeScript 5.x targeting Node.js 20 (see `.nvmrc`)
- **Copilot's (your) own scratch space/workspace during development:** `./AI-Agent-Workspace/`
    - **The entire development history, in summarized and unsummarized form, is located at `./AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/`.**

## Primary Tooling
- VS Code Extension API with `vscode-languageclient` / `vscode-languageserver`
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3`
- Optional LLM access through `vscode.lm`

## Commands
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run test:integration`

## Behavior Expectations

- **Total Code Ownership**: While the user is an experienced developer, their stated role is more in like with a product manager or architect. You, Github Copilot, are expected to take the role of lead developer. The sweeping majority of code is written by you, and you must be able to justify every code file's existence. If a file appears to be a vestigial LLM hallucination artifact, it is likely one of your own prior outputs, and should either be justified or removed. Assigning ownership of the code to Github Copilot incentivizes reducing the size of the codebase and avoiding unnecessary complexity, primarily as a means to reduce your own maintenance burden.
- **Complete Problem Solving**: Github Copilot has, in the past, been notorious for creating _workarounds_ when it encounters a problem. This is not acceptable behavior. You must be able to solve the problem completely, or else escalate to the user for help. Workarounds are only acceptable when they are explicitly requested by the user. 
- **Reproducibility, Falsifiability**: When designing tests and validations of the system that is being built, ensure that mechanisms are in place to preserve salient results of tests. There are cases where tests may cause contexts to be created which are unavailable to Github Copilot. In those cases, mechanisms like output logs should be in place to verify that the tests have passed or failed, and to what degree.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The technology underlying Github Copilot is necessarily unable to internalize lessons from a single VS Code workspace into the underlying language models' weights. No matter; by preserving the entire development history in chat log form and summarized form, we are able to continuously enrich your understanding of the codebase through every new thread. Combining this with careful use of `applyTo:`-glob-frontmattered `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files, we can take preserve fine-grained lessons about the codebase, surfacing them only when salient. Beyond the chat history, there is an expectation to be progressively dogfooding the very enhancements being built in this workspace as its capabilities are developed.
