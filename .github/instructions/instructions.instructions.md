# Instructions Files

This is an instruction file. It will be presented to Github Copilot as context when it is generating or editing files matching the glob pattern specified in the `applyTo` field above. Author instruction files to fine-tune Copilot's behavior for specific responsibilities or file types throughout the workspace. If you instead want to modify Copilot's behavior globally, edit the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.
