You are being asked to extract key signals from the provided [chat history export](/AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/) file. 

Please read the [MDMD Instructions](../instructions/mdmd.instructions.md) file for guidance on how to identify signals which correspond to a given layer. 

Once you are comfortable with which signals correspond to each layer, please sample the signal files from our first conversation, `2025.10.16.layer1.md` to `2025.10.16.layer4.md`, as well as the day prior to the day you're summarizing (if available), to get a sense of the style and formatting from a good example (10/16) and a temporally salient sample (target date - 1).  

Finally, extract the key signals corresponding to each MDMD layer from the conversation history file, **1200 lines at a time**. 

**Do not check back in until the entire conversation history is parsed.** This means that, before the copilot response is completed, **at least one lossy autosummarization process will occur**. In order to maintain continuity, **you must rehydrate from the signal files you have already generated** so that you do not lose progress. 

When extracting signals, please follow these rules:

**You must emit edits to the signal files you are generating for each 1200 lines of conversation history parsed**. 
**Failure to do so will cause looping repeat work due to autosummarization behaviors and context limits**.
**If autosummarization occurs during signal extraction, rehydrate with each signal file you have generated so far to avoid losing progress**.
**To avoid causing needless human-in-the-loop pauses in the agentic runner, please use LLM 'read_file' (or simiar-named equivalent) tool calls rather than terminal commands**.
