You have been requested to summarize the following dev day conversation file into an auditable, turn-by-turn conversation summary in the same style as the other dev day summaries. 

**PLEASE READ ALL PRIOR SUMMARIES IN FULL BEFORE SUMMARIZING YESTERDAY'S CONVERSATION**

[Development Chat History Summary Folder](/AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/)

Next, extract turn-by-turn conversation summaries, with a preference for direct quotes as practical, **1200 lines at a time**. Emit an update to the summary file after each 1200 lines of conversation history parsed.

[Raw Development Chat History Folder](/AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/)

**Do not check back in until the entire conversation history is parsed.** This means that, before the copilot response is completed, **at least one lossy autosummarization process will occur**. In order to maintain continuity, **you must rehydrate from the summary file you have already generated** so that you do not lose progress. 

**You must emit edits to the chat history summary file you are generating for each 1200 lines of conversation history parsed**. 
**Failure to do so will cause looping repeat work due to autosummarization behaviors and context limits**.
**If autosummarization occurs during signal extraction, rehydrate with the conversation summary file you have generated so far to avoid losing progress**.
**To avoid causing needless human-in-the-loop pauses in the agentic runner, please use LLM 'read_file' (or simiar-named equivalent) tool calls rather than terminal commands**.
