# User Intent Census – Link-Aware Diagnostics

Tracking the explicit guidance provided by `jfjordanfarr` across Dev Days 1–11. Each entry references the source chat log and line range so future agents can reconstruct the full context during autosummarization windows.

## 2025-10-16 (Dev Day 1)
- `2025-10-16.md:L1-L32` — Mandate: build a system that raises IntelliSense-style diagnostics between linked markdown layers and implementation files; adopt the four-layer MDMD documentation model.
- `L160-L213` — Request deep research on VS Code vs. LSP backends and polyglot graph strategies; approves pursuing Language Server architecture despite extension tooling friction.
- `L246-L344` — Emphasizes riding existing language server improvements, leveraging parser tiers, and prioritizing provenance/confidence in the graph.
- `L378-L517` — Runs full SpecKit bootstrap (`/speckit.specify`, `.plan`, `.tasks`, `.analyze`); expects docs to stay authoritative and updated.
- `L693-L716` — Executes `/speckit.clarify`; chooses option **C** (block diagnostics until user explicitly selects an LLM provider) for responsible AI consent.
- `L1005-L1146` — Redirects link discovery toward VS Code’s workspace indexing model; insists on inference-first graph rebuilds, no manual front matter.
- `L1707-L1816` — Clarifies AST benchmark use for development-time verification; reaffirms MDMD layering per implementation artifacts.
## 2025-11-18 (Dev Day 27)
- `2025-11-18.md:L206-L223` — Expand LD-402 coverage into ambiguous signal stacks (Blazor polyglot pages, queued worker pipelines, reflection-heavy ecosystems) so the pathfinder proves fearless-change analysis across messy cross-language workflows.
- `L222-L229` — Continue operating with high agency and minimal status noise; let diffs narrate progress and only break stride for fork-in-the-road decisions or autosummarisation recovery.
- `L369-L378` — When introducing new fixtures, author Purpose/Notes for their Layer‑4 Live Docs and land representative tests in the same commit so each day’s narrative remains test-backed.
- `L1259-L1266` — Never hand-edit generated Live Doc sections; resolve slug/anchor collisions by improving the generator so it emits unique headings automatically.
- `L2924-L2998` — Treat repeated “preserving authored content” warnings as a signal to broaden the Live Docs glob configuration; keep the default config in sync with fixture asset types so regeneration owns those docs.
- `L3305-L3318` — Restore a green `npm run safe:commit` by fixing the suites rather than discarding work; avoid destructive resets while chasing passing gates.
- `L3604-L3609` — Do not run blanket `git checkout -- .mdmd`; apply surgical edits to documentation mirrors and respect the Stage‑0 safeguard against mass rollbacks.
- `L2177-L2765` — Grants high-agency execution of SpecKit tasks T022–T038, stressing continuous checklist audits and documentation alignment.

## 2025-11-19 (Dev Day 28)
- `2025-11-19.md:L365-L408` — Inspect Gemini’s Antigravity experiment, keep the new `layer4-orphans` enforcement fully configurable (default-off, easy to revert), and reserve Layer-3 system docs for curated human narratives rather than bulk-generated materialized views.
- `L1535-L1540` — Before staging, reread the refreshed Layer-3 docs and clear all `live-docs:lint` warnings by authoring missing Purpose/Notes so the documentation feels human-edited instead of computer-generated.

## 2025-10-17 (Dev Day 2)
- `2025-10-17.md:L1-L140` — Demands rigorous daily summaries (10:1 compression, turn-by-turn, line ranges) to preserve auditability; verifies LSP decision provenance.
- `L164-L376` — Orders `/speckit.implement` continuation (T026 onward); expects Copilot to own lint/test setup and resolve Node tooling friction.
- `L455-L870` — Drives sequential completion of T028–T032 with SpecKit hydration, integration test seeding, and ongoing doc updates.
- `L1065-L1310` — Coordinates git hygiene, manual cleanup of tool artifacts, and staged commits before machine handoff; insists lint noise be addressed at the configuration level.

## 2025-10-19 (Dev Day 3)
- `2025-10-19.md:L1-L210` — Repeats summary mandate plus git correlation; praises adherence and reinforces summary-as-source-of-truth credo.
- `L239-L808` — Pushes for hysteresis implementation (T033) and full integration harness; reports manual onboarding blockers that must be automated.
- `L1110-L1613` — Flags communication gaps; directs deterministic onboarding, readiness commands, and resilience against integration host crashes.
- `L2094-L2216` — After commit, reorients product focus toward code-to-code ripple detection before doc drift; mandates spec realignment (US1 vs. US2) and successive T034–T038 delivery.
- `L2399-L2765` — Offers manual file deletions when tooling falls short; expects GraphStore stubs, automation of better-sqlite3 rebuilds, and commits once suites are green.

## 2025-10-20 (Dev Day 4)
- `2025-10-20.md:L1-L236` — Starts day with recap + commit provenance updates; authorizes T035 once spec hydration reread.
- `L642-L962` — Greenlights documentation-first practice for new capabilities; approves MDMD layering with explicit links to SpecKit sections.
- `L1690-L1804` — Reinforces 1:1 mapping between MDMD layers and implementation files; demands double-checks after autosummarization cycles.
- `L2056-L2392` — Validates knowledge graph ingestion work, ensures doc cleanup, and maintains policy of committing chat history for audit trails.
- `L2487-L2911` — Chooses Option A (continue implementation), instructs manual assistance for long-file edits, and ensures runtime modularization despite tooling limitations.
- `L3651-L4476` — Updates Copilot instructions regarding large files; authorizes continued T041 execution and expects commits to include chat logs.

## 2025-10-21 (Dev Day 5)
- `2025-10-21.md:L1-L86` — Opens with summary request for 10/20 and demands concrete planning beyond prior “Next Phase” bullets.
- `L81-L752` — Embeds previous summaries in chat for persistent grounding; approves implementation of ripple UX/falsifiability remediation.
- `L987-L1405` — Requests lint/test reruns, rebuilds, prioritization among options (Implementation vs. Falsifiability vs. Documentation); selects **Option B** for falsifiability focus.
- `L1411-L1470` — Specifies three falsifiability scenarios (broken markdown links, false positive guardrails, metaprogramming transforms); emphasizes prompt-cost model to encourage high-agency check-ins.
- `L1470-L1854` — Authorizes creation of falsifiability MDMD docs, new integration suites (US3–US5), and staging/committing of related fixtures.
- `L1854-L1923` — Directs transition toward MDMD crystallization: bottom-up sweep completion followed by top-down census of every `jfjordanfarr:` prompt.

## 2025-10-22 (Dev Day 6)
- `2025-10-22.md:L1-L8`  
	> Hello! Today is 10/22/2025 and it a new dev day. Whenever we start a new dev day, we begin by summarizing the previous dev day into an auditable, line-range-referenced, turn-by-turn summary doc, which can later be used as a compressed reference for user intent and the trajectory of development/the overall vision. Once you've completed that, we'll talk about next concrete development steps. This exercise is performed to keep development aligned and contextualized across many sessions. (Today is dev day six!)

	> Are we sure this is wise? It wouldn't surprise me if we came up with file type-specific enrichments that could enhance our workspace index, but I would be surprised if the overall shape of our solution involves classifying a bunch of file extensions into either DOCS or CODE. I mean, when you see our MDMD documentation, it's quite a mix, no? We envision using LLMs to help develop pseudocode AST based on plain text files of virtually any type, I would imagine. What file types do we NOT want our system to care about (aside from perhaps gitignored files)?

## 2025-10-23 (Dev Day 7)

- `L1248-L1417` — Directs execution of T059 drift history persistence and propagating updates across `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and related docs.
- `L2404-L2439` — Orders a Layer-4 MDMD audit to ensure each implementation doc cites its test coverage and schedules any missing entries.
- `L3236-L3394` — Warns that Copilot’s partial test reporting is unreliable; requires treating `npm run verify` as running until the full integration transcript is reviewed.

## 2025-10-24 (Dev Day 8)
- `2025-10-24.md:L1-L126` — Reasserts the 1000-line summary cadence with commit correlations before starting T067.
- `L297-L329` — Authorizes MDMD-first implementation of T067 after hydrating with all prior summaries.
- `L1095-L1233` — Presses for automation of the workspace snapshot (“golden fixture”) so Copilot has complete visibility while dogfooding.
- `L2728-L3021` — Flags that `npm run verify` is skipping integration tests and expects root-cause analysis to restore the full pipeline.
- `L6360-L6767` — Chooses Option A for the next work tranche, forbids editing compiled `.js` artifacts, and reiterates that TypeScript sources are authoritative.
- `L8363-L8724` — Demands high-agency documentation sweeps to shrink the SlopCop backlog, citing per-prompt billing as the incentive.
- `L8989-L9094` — Requests commit preparation and questions whether `workspace.snapshot.json` should remain untracked before pushing.

## 2025-10-25 (Dev Day 9)
- `2025-10-25.md:L1-L120` — Initiates Day 9 with the Dev Day 8 summary request, maintaining the piton process and commit correlation discipline.
- `L651-L780` — Defines the first SlopCop milestone: detect broken Markdown links, ship a CLI, and integrate it into maintainer workflows.
- `L881-L940` — Insists the SlopCop effort aligns with Layer-1/Layer-2 vision docs and updates the roadmap accordingly.
- `L1461-L1750` — Provides `safe:commit` logs and expects a true fix for the Verify crash rather than incremental doc tweaks.
- `L2101-L2280` — Directs Vitest thread experimentation (down to single-thread) until `npm run verify` completes reliably.
- `L3401-L3980` — Chooses documentation alignment as the immediate priority, then authorizes autonomous integration of SlopCop into maintainer tooling.
- `L4051-L4320` — Grants high-agency execution for deeper asset linting, expecting status only when work is commit-ready.
- `L4651-L5000` — Pushes for symbol-level SlopCop design (slug canonicalization, duplicate handling) and requires SpecKit updates before implementation.
- `L5901-L6260` — After confirming symbol tooling, instructs enabling the audit repo-wide and finishing cleanup so `safe:commit` can enforce it.

## 2025-10-26 (Dev Day 10)
- `2025-10-26.md:L1-L760` — Reiterates the piton-based summary process and forbids bulk reads that trigger lossy autosummarization.
- `L861-L1000` — Vetoes manual `<a id>` anchors in specs; symbol coverage must be restored by fixing headings or callers within Markdown norms.
- `L1121-L1240` — Authorizes sensible heading renames in MDMD, allows ignoring fixture duplicates, and clarifies the symbol-audit backlog (seven MDMD gaps plus duplicate fixtures).
- `L2181-L2320` — Corrects the assumption of a built-in Ollama connector, directing the use of VS Code’s AI Toolkit to register local models before analyzing with AI.
- `L2321-L2700` — Reports the Electron ABI crash while dogfooding Gemma and instructs a forced dual-ABI rebuild for `better-sqlite3`.
- `L3001-L3320` — Shares verify logs showing integration still failing without the Electron binary, expecting Copilot to unblock the test harness.
- `L3601-L3914` — Sets the bar at 100% exported-symbol coverage via heading-based docs while emphasizing high-agency execution.

## 2025-10-27 (Dev Day 11)
- `2025-10-27.md:L1-L716` — Reasserts the 1000-line summary workflow, warns about autosummarization, and demands higher-agency execution before status updates.
- `L808-L905` — Orders a full re-read of all summaries, a narrative recap, and a prioritized next-step list highlighting symbol orphan detection.
- `L902-L1374` — Challenges Copilot to verify whether orphan warnings are legitimate, then instructs tightening `extractExportedSymbolsSection` or removing stray backtick literals so audits focus on identifier-shaped tokens.
- `L1657-L1939` — Requires every Layer-4 heading to mention its exported symbol in backticks, rerun the audit, and restore 100% coverage before prepping the commit.
- `L3016-L3101` — Questions unnecessary doc formatting edits, authorizes finishing the symbol lint fix, and requests commit preparation once coverage stays green.

## 2025-11-03 (Dev Day 12)
- `2025-11-03.md:L78-L170` — Continue summarizing the 11/02 chat in ~1200-line pitons with commit correlation, then narrate the project’s development story to prep for the next benchmark onboarding.
- `L391-L470` — Split benchmark reporting into per-mode Markdown artifacts with non-committed verbose failure logs so divergences stay inspectable.
- `L716-L820` — Update `copilot-instructions.md` and related docs to document the reporting workflow, then investigate benchmark divergences across AST and self-similarity suites.
- `L944-L1015` — Resume TypeScript precision/recall remediation (toy fixtures first), tracking hypotheses about fallback overreach versus real-world fixture success.
- `L2144-L2155` — After autosummarization, rehydrate from the specified slice of chat history and bias logging so failures appear before successes to protect context budget.
- `L2727-L2760` — Follow the four-step recovery checklist (rehydrate, review benchmark results, fix TypeScript fixture mismatches, ignore negative-control exports) before proceeding.
- `L3448-L3560` — Design and implement a compiler-backed TypeScript oracle via Code Like Clay: document scope, prototype generator, compare against committed expectations, and retain manual graph overlays for cross-language edges (see MAJOR NOTE).
- `L3622-L3645` — Operate with high agency, escalate blockers, and ground decisions in empirically provable workspace graph correctness.
- `L3705-L3710` — On subsequent autosummarization, rehydrate over `#file:2025-11-03.md:2840-3703` before resuming analysis.
- `L5146-L5208` — Address every automated VS Code code-review comment, confirming or rejecting suggestions with rationale.

## 2025-11-04 (Dev Day 13)
- `2025-11-04.md:L1-L110` — Begin the day by rehydrating dev-history context, producing the prior-day summary with commit correlations, and updating the intent census so future sessions stay auditably grounded.
- `L204-L236` — Avoid duplicating compiler toolchains for customers; instead, consume the workspace’s existing compilers or language servers via thin CLI orchestration while keeping the extension itself lean.
- `L248-L258` — Uphold the docs-first workflow by ensuring new oracle efforts are captured in SpecKit tasks and Layer‑2 MDMD entries before implementation proceeds.
- `L3644-L3662` — Proactively fix outdated names (e.g., rename regeneration scripts) without waiting for explicit direction; treat clarity and professionalism as part of code health.
- `L4296-L4332` — Do not insert manual `<a id>` anchors in MDMD; resolve SlopCop link issues by aligning headings and slugs, and drive the workspace to commit-ready state instead of papering over warnings.
- `L4756-L4848` — Guard the integrity of Layer‑4 docs—if edits degrade canonical sections, repair them immediately rather than accepting reduced structure or intent capture.

## 2025-11-05 (Dev Day 14)
- `2025-11-05.md:L2511-L2536` — Regenerate each benchmark fixture’s `expected.json` from the pinned oracle snapshot (layer manual bridges via overrides when needed); avoid treating the files as sacrosanct hand edits because the AST output should stay recomputable.
- `L2601-L2601` — If `npm run safe:commit --benchmarks` fails to refresh fixtures, fix the pipeline so the command always performs the full regeneration before benchmarks execute.
- `L3483-L3488` — After safe-commit runs, compare benchmark precision/recall against the previous commit to surface regressions explicitly.
- `L3519-L3528` — Investigate why libuv’s ground truth shrank to two curated edges and restore a reproducible baseline with minimal hardcoded relationships.
- `L3539-L3540` — Ensure the C oracle scans header files; missing header coverage is unacceptable.
- `L3646-L3654` — Treat any benchmark that dips below the 0.6 precision/recall gates as a failure requiring immediate investigation, prioritizing correctness over expedience—especially for full third-party fixtures that should cover as much code as practicable.
- `L3940-L3953` — When autosummarization occurs, rehydrate from the specified chat range (e.g., `#file:2025-11-05.md:266-3934`) and restate context before continuing work.
- `L3966-L3972` — Optionally author a `*.instructions.md` guard for benchmark `expected.json` files to remind future edits that regeneration is the canonical workflow.
- `L4133-L4137` — Align MDMD tooling docs with actual exports (e.g., fix the `runCli` reference for the fallback inference recorder) so graph audits stay green.
- `L4141-L4145` — Use the lightweight benchmark loop (`node scripts/run-benchmarks.mjs --suite ast`, Vitest focus runs, targeted fixture regeneration) to iterate on heuristics until all suites meet accuracy thresholds.

## 2025-11-06 (Dev Day 15)
- `2025-11-06.md:L1-L24` — Follow `devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md` for the 11/05 recap, correlate it to commit 536ff11b, and review that commit’s code changes once the summary lands.
- `L92-L125` — After the summary and commit review finish, provide an explicit check-in and capture fresh directives in `user-intent-census.md` so the audit trail stays current.
- `L195-L198` — Rehydrate `#file:001-link-aware-diagnostics` and `#file:layer-2` before planning; prioritize regenerating benchmark data and investigating any failures as the first action.
- `L700-L756` — Fix `npm run safe:commit --benchmarks` so fixture regeneration runs only once per pipeline instead of repeating during subsequent benchmark steps.
- `L1792-L2032` — Proceed with the OkHttp AST benchmark fixture and eliminate false positives by improving heuristics rather than introducing manual overrides.
- `L3112-L3112` — Update the Layer-2 roadmap and SpecKit tasks with requirement checkboxes before implementing the C# oracle, supporting fixtures, and Roslyn slice.
- `L3996-L4003` — Ensure T112 includes the WebForms chain (`Web.config` → `Globals.cs` → code-behind → ASPX hidden fields → client JS) so cross-language ripples stay observable.
- `L5026-L5080` — Wait for integration runs to finish and review their logs before reporting success; do not rely on tooling that fires prior to test completion.
- `L6684-L6684` — Drive the workspace back to “safe commit-ready” after the C#/Roslyn updates with lint, tests, benchmarks, graph audit, and SlopCop all passing.

## 2025-11-07 (Dev Day 16)
- `2025-11-07.md:L1-L70` — Begin each day by following `devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md` to recap 11/06, explicitly tying the summary to commits dd7e1076, 80d58f7b, a49ac2e3, and ae4a33e2.
- `L205-L240` — Ensure the summary contains a dedicated commit-correlation section for those changes and review the associated docs/code diffs before starting new work.
- `L242-L270` — Refresh `user-intent-census.md` with signals from the 11/06 chat once the summary lands so the audit log stays current.
- `L320-L360` — Revalidate tasks like T103/T104 by rerunning benchmarks, confirming completion before checking boxes, and investigate any outstanding OkHttp or Requests follow-ups.
- `L413-L444` — Close out T104/T091 by adding regression tests for the new language heuristics, documenting OkHttp builder coverage, and keep `--benchmarks` execution opt-in for CI.
- `L620-L676` — Refactor `fallbackInference.ts` into per-language heuristic modules mapped to their globs; the 2k-line monolith is unacceptable going forward.
- `L700-L756` — Define shared TypeScript interfaces/pure helpers so each heuristic module is easily testable and new languages drop in with minimal friction.
- `L824-L832` — Document the refactor plan in Layer‑3/Layer‑4 MDMD before migrating code.
- `L1130-L1148` — After autosummarization events, rehydrate from the specified chat slice (e.g., `#file:2025-11-07.md:310-1135`) before resuming.
- `L2680-L2720` — Resolve SlopCop anchor errors by matching the GitHub slug (e.g., `comp003--heuristic-suite`) rather than inserting manual anchors.
- `L3005-L3055` — When safe-commit passes, craft a comprehensive commit message, tick the completed SpecKit tasks, and capture the test suite invoked.

## 2025-11-08 (Dev Day 17)
- `2025-11-08.md:L1-L120` — Begin the day by following `devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md` for the 11/7 recap; treat this as the standing opener for each dev day while maintaining the autosummarization guard rails.
- `L72-L210` — Safeguard git history: fix malformed commit messages via cherry-pick/ammend choreography and keep Copilot responsible for surgical git operations when manual mistakes occur.
- `L202-L240` — Refresh `user-intent-census.md` with every new dev-day signal so autosummarization-resistant context remains accurate.
- `L268-L376` — Before proposing Live Documentation refactors, reread Layer‑1 vision, the entire Layer‑2 folder, every Layer‑3 doc, and the full `001-link-aware-diagnostics` spec set; no planning without full-context ingestion.
- `L460-L522` — Create a temporary “live-documentation-doc-refactor-plan.md” checklist to persist intent across autosummarization, aiming for Layer‑4 docs generated under `/.live-documentation/` as the end state.
- `L542-L576` — Keep “Evidence” in the generated portion when derivable from coverage; integration/acceptance tests must list their exercised implementation artifacts in a generated “Targets” section, with lint warnings when real code lacks evidence.
- `L582-L909` — After every lossy autosummarization step, rehydrate the specified chat slice before responding, then execute the checklist with minimal chatter—only surface blockers or fork-in-the-road decisions.
- `L608-L640` — Decide between a single layered instruction file versus archetype-specific globbed instructions, but ensure Layer‑4 guidance explicitly covers implementation/tests/assets.
- `L622-L1274` — Work with “total agency,” letting documentation diffs speak for progress; pause only to escalate decisions, and keep instructions plus SpecKit artifacts synchronized with the evolving plan.
- `L1149-L1314` — Focus the refactor on populating `/.live-documentation/`, consider the long-term migration away from `.mdmd/`, and stage outputs into a dedicated layer (e.g., `/.live-documentation/layer-4/`) for diff-driven review.
- `L1432-L1600` — Maintain heads-down execution across large doc edits, rehydrating when prompted and keeping Copilot instructions up to date with new conventions.
- `L1685-L2018` — Treat checklist items like LD-102/LD-105 as active requirements (schema definition, provenance capture, evidence waivers) and close them with concrete artifacts and tests.
- `L2984-L3408` — Manage context pressure by throttling generator output (`npm run live-docs:generate` should emit a single summary line), ensure coverage manifests persist between test runs, and recognize that `coverage/` is gitignored.
- `L3065-L3185` — Enforce H4 headings for each public symbol to keep markdown linkable; dependency entries must link to sibling Live Docs instead of raw TS paths.
- `L3391-L3677` — Restore `live-docs` manifests after coverage wipes, hook `npm run live-docs:targets` into the pipeline post-tests, and extend manifest generation to cover transitive evidence consumers.
- `L3811-L3830` — Clear remaining lint warnings by either expanding manifest entries, adding targeted tests, or introducing waivers—choose deliberately and document the choice after rehydrating from the provided chat span.
- `L4105-L4635` — Keep the orchestrated `npm run livedocs` flow (targets → generate → lint), justify its ordering, and retain informative but concise terminal output.
- `L4963-L5342` — Audit generated Live Docs for verbosity: require concise “Observed Evidence” groupings, mandate Live Doc links in Targets, and note that large untracked doc bursts are expected until git staging catches up.
- `L5629-L6009` — Implement formatting simplifications: drop implementation-side “Observed Evidence” blocks, hide empty sections, slim authored templates, stabilize provenance timestamps, and plan lint coverage for orphan docs/symbols.
- `L5841-L6017` — For test Live Docs (e.g., `fallbackInference.test.ts`), ensure Targets link to Live Docs—not raw sources—and iterate until integration configs accept workspace sources without `rootDir` rejections.

## 2025-11-09 (Dev Day 18)
- `2025-11-09.md:L149-L233` — Reassess progress against the live-doc refactor plan before coding; “commit-ready” requires being more stable/capable than the prior commit while clearing wasteful artifacts and documenting the remaining checklist.
- `L373-L395` — Keep the generated `Observed Evidence` block optional; surface it only when coverage or waivers add value, while lint should validate structure only when the section exists.
- `L792-L804` — Quiet persistent lint by always emitting a `Supporting Fixtures` section for tests, even if it carries a temporary placeholder until smarter metadata lands.
- `L1027-L1055` — Prioritise stability over premature optimisation: raise Windows latency tolerances (up to ~5 s and beyond) and allow downgrade-to-warning hooks when the host machine thrashes.
- `L1111-L1162` — Define commit readiness as the point where Live Docs are regenerated, pipelines run clean, and the base layer has fully migrated into `.live-documentation/` without leftover `.mdmd` artifacts.
- `L1210-L1214` — When porting docs, verify each Live Doc against the real source/test files instead of trusting legacy prose, ensuring Purpose/Notes remain truthful.
- `L1236-L1240` — Drop the legacy `Description` header entirely—authored content should include only Purpose and Notes, with Stage 0 regeneration proving the slimmer template persists.
- `L5079-L5087` — Detect orphaned Live Docs (e.g., stray `.mdmd.md` mirrors without code) so the Stage 0 mirror stays authoritative and free of dead artifacts.

## 2025-11-10 (Dev Day 19)
- `2025-11-10.md:L236-L340` — Compile a temporary MDMD layer content census by mining chat history so every proposal for Live Documentation layers, archetypes, and constraints is auditable in one place.
- `L400-L512` — When logging census guidance, tag each directive with its capture date and align entries to the simplified base-layer template (authored Purpose/Notes; generated Public Symbols + Dependencies) to avoid mixing superseded rules.
- `L728-L915` — Keep upper-layer automation simple: use authored checkboxes for Layer 2 requirements/acceptance criteria, reserve generated sections for adjacent rollups (Components, Topology, Completion snapshots), and preserve downward-only links.
- `L1000-L1104` — Allow each Layer 2 doc to cite exactly one upstream capability/release so Layer 1 rollups remain deterministic even if that briefly violates the downward-only link rule for the curated layers.
- `L1030-L1120` — Standardise the six System-layer archetypes (Component, Interaction/API, Data Model, Workflow, Integration, Testing) around shared `Purpose`/`Notes` authored sections and generated `Components`/`Topology` blocks so Layer 2 can mix and match them deterministically.
- `L1124-L1185` — Treat Layers 3/4 as the deterministic spine and Layers 1/2 as curated intent: System docs stay machine-derived from Stage‑0 signals, while Capability/Commitment docs remain human-authored with lightweight generated tallies.
- `L1222-L1245` — Retain numerical layer identifiers but adopt the alias names (Capability, Commitment, System, Implementation) to clarify the intent of each tier without renumbering.
- `L1310-L1355` — Derive System-layer docs strictly from Stage‑0 (Implementation-layer) Live Docs; legacy Layer‑3 MDMD files may only be used for validation, not as scaffolding.
- `L1344-L1505` — Gather deterministic signals (component SCCs, CLI surfaces, schemas, workflows, integrations, testing) and refactor the Live Docs generator into shared core + layer adapters so the System layer can reuse the pipeline safely.
- `L1451-L1492` — Break out shared generation plumbing from the monolithic `generator.ts`, then introduce per-layer generators (starting with System) to keep files maintainable and layering explicit.
- `L2188-L2205` — Retire churn-metric ideas tied to local git history; focus future analytics on deterministic co-activation signals sourced from workspace artifacts instead of developer-specific data.
- `L2392-L2404` — Treat LLM assistance as optional for ambiguous System-doc archetype assignments (sample multiple times, log inputs), ensure every Implementation doc appears in at least one System doc, and resolve dynamic branches by replicating the manual reasoning process before automating it.

## 2025-11-11 (Dev Day 20)
- `2025-11-11.md:L1-L15` — Follow `devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md` for the 11/10 recap and tie the summary directly to commit `1da1b96e84bba2966469378ae13751817e7f7435`.
- `L82-L120` — After any lossy autosummarisation, immediately rehydrate on the latest chat slice and capture the 11/10 directives in the census files before resuming work.
- `L365-L378` — Operate with high agency while preserving the context window: rehydrate when summaries drop and keep chatter minimal so diffs narrate progress.
- `L509-L518` — Own the codebase cleanliness; proactively fix technical debt or poor file organisation instead of working around it.
- `L553-L560` — Avoid editing files once they exceed roughly 500 lines (1 000 at the absolute ceiling); refactor large modules into smaller units to keep LLM edits reliable.
- `L577-L595` — Verify full-file reads after autosummarisation and escalate blockers only when necessary while maintaining low-noise status updates.
- `L1130-L1164` — Manually review generated System docs to confirm they are useful and publication-worthy before keeping them in the repo.
- `L1262-L1283` — Justify co-activation clusters with statistical evidence (hypergeometric/Fisher tests plus BH-controlled p- or e-values) instead of heuristic caps.
- `L1530-L1558` — Treat System-layer docs as ephemeral materialised views that surface technical debt, leaving Layer 4 as the sole durable authored layer.
- `L1563-L1600` — Harmonise Layer 1 vision, Layer 2 roadmap, specs, instructions, and the refactor plan to reflect the materialised-view strategy.
- `L1878-L1895` — Schedule tasks to stand up a GitHub Pages-style Capability layer, let Spec-Kit assume Layer 2, and keep `copilot-instructions.md` current with layer aliases and CLI updates.
- `L2208-L2245` — Document the planned transition to a formal `Live-Docs` repo (paths, cleanup, professional polish) before starting the static site work.
- `L2470-L2485` — Maintain a canonical CLI command catalog and update documentation whenever new npm scripts or flags are introduced.

## 2025-11-12 (Dev Day 21)
- `2025-11-12.md:L1-L84` — Rehydrate the dev-history workflow by following `devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md` for the 11/11 recap, correlating it with commit `5a20f2e8ddd8091879492915ee5d79e0668346c0` before starting new work.
- `L64-L176` — Keep the intent and MDMD layer censuses current (including rereads of both files) and double-check `tasks.md` after the earlier miscue so planning artifacts stay aligned.
- `L179-L220` — Prioritise polyglot Live Doc emitters against in-repo fixtures first, only expanding to external repositories once local coverage is solid.
- `L304-L360` — Provide a proactive change plan covering the language-adapter abstraction and the new `tests/integration/live-docs/polyglot-fixtures.test.ts`, then execute with high-agency, low-chatter follow-through.
- `L790-L840` — Treat docstring bridging as a structured surface: emit per-symbol `##### \`Name\` — Field` headings so every recommended XML tag has a uniquely addressable slot in Live Docs.

## 2025-11-14 (Dev Day 23)
- `2025-11-14.md:L2850-L2865` — Evidence for new docstring adapters must be both machine-verifiable (unit/integration/benchmark suites) and manually inspected; always dogfood Live Docs in non-TypeScript languages and finish with `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks` before calling the work ready.
- `L2989-L3045` — Before touching code for another language adapter, walk the relevant files, produce a full implementation plan (syntax coverage, tests, manual inspection, schema impacts), operate with low chatty output, and rehydrate via the cited snippet plus local diffs whenever autosummarization interrupts.
- `L3332-L3340` — After adapter work, generate Live Docs for the affected fixtures in an isolated workspace, review the Markdown by hand, and only then rerun the full safe-commit pipeline.
- `L3410-L3485` — Restore real Ollama usage during integration tests by pointing both `LINK_AWARE_OLLAMA_MODEL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL` to `qwen3-coder:30b`, capturing traces under `AI-Agent-Workspace/ollama-traces`, and rejecting the mock-response fallback going forward.
- `L880-L1338` — Design a language-agnostic documentation schema that captures summaries, remarks, params/type params, returns/value, exceptions, examples, links, and raw fragments, preserving unsupported tags for later tooling.
- `L1340-L1380` — Codify the structured docstring commitments across Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, and the `001-link-aware-diagnostics` spec so the roadmap and architecture stay synchronized with the implementation plan.
- `L1760-L1785` — After major code passes, rehydrate on the full day’s chat log before continuing, then resume with high agency once alignment is confirmed.
- `L3724-L3770` — Before proposing a commit, inspect the diffs for unexpected changes (chat history included) and surface the suggested commit message in chat.
- `L4750-L4760` — Ensure the final commit narrative reflects both the planning/documentation half and the adapter/test implementation so the day’s story stays coherent.

## 2025-11-13 (Dev Day 22)
- `2025-11-13.md:L1-L36` — Keep the dev-day ritual: summarize 11/12 via `devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md` and correlate it to commit `b2b8f7590d928fd356a0df008de17d3e6bfc51e3` before taking on new work.
- `L1330-L1346` — Sanitize Javadoc block tags (e.g., `<p>`, `<br>`) inside the Java adapter, regenerate the fixture, and rerun the pipeline so Live Docs stay Markdown-native.
- `L1513-L1565` — Extend Layer 1/Layer 2/Layer 3 docs plus `001-link-aware-diagnostics` to capture the stretch goal of Live Documentation-backed authoring and two-way docstring bridges.
- `L1771-L1784` — Standardise on “Live Documentation” as the formal product name; avoid “LiveDocs” in persisted artifacts to prevent brand collisions.
- `L1888-L1998` — Drive the workspace cleanup plan: prepare for a repo rename to `Live-Documentation`, stand up a future `docs/site/` GitHub Pages scaffold, purge temp debris, and keep ChatHistory organised by year/month folders.
- `L2238-L2244` — Treat historical ChatHistory entries as read-only audit artifacts; do not rewrite or auto-migrate their internal links during tooling passes.

## 2025-11-15 (Dev Day 24)
- `2025-11-15.md:L372-L385` — Capture the Cloudflare-hosted public showcase plan across vision, roadmap, and spec docs so we can run Live Documentation on OSS repos, return zipped outputs, and still position the extension as the primary offline product.
- `L698-L788` — Document that the hosted showcase is marketing-only: it must never starve or replace local workflows, and our roadmap should explicitly call out support for VS Code forks (Windsurf, Cursor, etc.) while purging speculative wording that could seed hallucinations.
- `L900-L1041` — Keep the static site fully DRY by projecting existing Layer 1–3 MDMD files via a deterministic Node/TypeScript builder (Astro is acceptable) and fold the site work into the CI/CD stage before tackling the hosted demo.
- `L1099-L1124` — Update Layer‑3 integration/benchmark plans to split harnesses by runtime context (extension vs. headless generator) so Options 2+3 remain the durable strategy for future containerised/demo deployments.
- `L1204-L1213` — Behaviour expectations now include “Do it the Right Way,” prioritising durable, complete solutions over quick fixes—especially for architecture, design patterns, and tests.
- `L1248-L1273` — Revise Layer‑3 instructions, delete legacy Layer‑4 MDMD, ensure the generator emits `.md` Live Docs, and add matching `*.instructions.md` guards for the new glob.
- `L2706-L2706` — Rehydrate and update `mdmd-layer-content-census.md` with signals from both 11/14 and 11/15 after any git reset so intent tracking stays accurate.
- `L2822-L2822` — After removing Layer‑4 MDMD, drive SlopCop markdown/symbol back to zero and rerun `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks` before resuming authored work.
- `2025-11-15.md:L3088-L3116` — Prefer deterministic TypeScript helpers (e.g., `scripts/doc-tools/list-layer4-links.ts`) for doc/link rewrites and avoid brittle shell/Python one-liners because the Win10 PowerShell environment is unreliable.
- `L4029-L4055` — Harden `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with an evergreen Stage‑0 preservation rule: never use bulk `git checkout`/`git restore` on `.live-documentation/**` or `.mdmd/**`; stage or stash first and reference today’s log as the cautionary tale.
- `2025-11-15.md:L4229-L4357` — When updating .github/copilot-instructions.md, express the Stage‑0 safeguard as the behaviour bullet “Git Commands Need Extra Care” (linking to `2025-11-15.SUMMARIZED.md`) and add “Safeguard In-Flight Work” so bulk git commands only run after commits/stashes/branches and outstanding work stays staged before destructive actions.

## 2025-11-17 (Dev Day 26)
- `2025-11-17.md:L433-L505` — Re-scope LD-402 into a dependency pathfinder: accept `--from/--to` (or single-endpoint) inputs, emit the hop-by-hop chain “Oracle of Bacon” style, and default to tracing terminal roots when only one endpoint is provided.
- `L519-L538` — Document the inspect CLI’s mission across Layer 1, Layer 2, and the spec before continuing implementation so future readers understand the tool’s purpose without reading the chat log.
- `L593-L606` — Materialise a test fixture that proves the WebForms hidden-field scenario end-to-end (JavaScript variable back to Web.config AppSettings) to validate the CLI’s pathfinding claims.
- `L1752-L1776` — Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to remind future sessions the inspect CLI exists, highlight JSON mode and inbound/outbound usage, and reinforce that Copilot should dogfood the tool routinely.
- `L1854-L1890` — Plan enhancements to cover Razor pages, SPA runtime configs, and reflection flows, keeping LLM assistance optional but available for ambiguous edges so deterministic heuristics stay primary.
- `L1901-L1906` — Operate with elevated agency, minimising chatter while escalating only when forks or roadblocks arise, to conserve context for the ongoing inspect CLI expansion.

## Usage Notes
- Treat this census as the canonical index of stakeholder intent; cross-link relevant bullets into Layer-1/Layer-2 MDMD documents as needed.
- When future autosummarization truncates context, rehydrate by locating the referenced `ChatHistory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` line ranges.
- Update this file when new design-shaping prompts appear so MDMD layers remain anchored to explicit guidance.
