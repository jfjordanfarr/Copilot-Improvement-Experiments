- **Artifacts**: `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-22.SUMMARIZED.md`.
- **Learning**: Daily recaps remain the entry point for continuity—link each summary to source logs and roadmap deltas.

## Turn 02: Cross-Day Trajectory Brief (Lines 121–170)
- **User** asked for a condensed development history based on all prior summaries; **Copilot** synthesized a day-by-day trajectory from Dev Days 1–6, reinforcing architectural milestones and tooling improvements.
- **Artifacts**: None (chat-only briefing).
- **Learning**: Periodic narrative refresh keeps long-running goals visible without rehydrating entire logs.

## Turn 03: Workspace Hydration & Option Framing (Lines 171–430)
- **User** supplied the workspace tree and requested top next steps; **Copilot** rehydrated SpecKit docs and MDMD layers, then pitched three options: T046 noise suppression, T059 drift history persistence, and T047 AI insights.
- **Artifacts**: None; planning pass referencing `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/*` and `.mdmd` layers.
- **Learning**: Combining SpecKit state with MDMD docs keeps option proposals anchored in surfaced requirements.

## Turn 04: T046 Authorization & Design Approach (Lines 431–520)
- **User** green-lit T046 and encouraged an MDMD-first workflow; **Copilot** began targeted research across diagnostics publishers, runtime settings, and spec references ahead of drafting docs.
- **Artifacts**: None yet; groundwork established for doc-driven implementation.
- **Learning**: Reaffirmed practice of designing the solution via MDMD before touching code.

## Turn 05: MDMD Authoring & Noise Filter Scaffolding (Lines 521–700)
- **Copilot** created `noiseFilter.mdmd.md`, updated diagnostics/runtime docs, and outlined runtime settings changes before scaffolding `noiseFilter.ts` and its unit suite.
- **Artifacts**: `.mdmd/layer-4/server-diagnostics/noiseFilter.mdmd.md`, updates to `.mdmd/layer-4/server-settings/settingsBridge.mdmd.md`, `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/noiseFilter.{ts,test.ts}`.
- **Learning**: Document-first approach clarified thresholds (confidence, depth, per-change, per-target) and how metrics should propagate.

## Turn 06: Publisher Integration & Runtime Wiring (Lines 701–880)
- **Copilot** threaded the filter through `publishDocDiagnostics.ts`, `publishCodeDiagnostics.ts`, adjusted tests, and expanded runtime settings to capture noise suppression overrides; unit coverage adapted to new metrics.
- **Artifacts**: Diagnostics publishers/tests updated; `packages/server/src/runtime/settings.ts` expanded to parse noise config.
- **Learning**: Noise budgets must flow from settings→publishers with consistent metrics for telemetry.

## Turn 07: Verification Cycle & Test Fixes (Lines 881–940)
- **User** ran `npm run verify`, revealing failing unit assertions (confidence threshold expectations, hysteresis metrics); **Copilot** corrected tests to reflect fallback confidence handling and added metrics assertions.
- **Tests**: `npm run verify` (initial failures), `npm run test:unit` (post-fix pass).
- **Learning**: Aligning tests with new telemetry surfaces prevents false regressions.

## Turn 08: Noise Suppression Complete (Lines 941–1000)
- **User** reran `npm run verify`; all suites passed. Noise suppression engine considered delivered with green lint/unit/integration pipeline.
- **Tests**: `npm run verify` (green).
- **Learning**: Deterministic verify run confirms noise filter integration across runtime, docs, and diagnostics stack.

## Turn 09: Post-T046 Validation & Commit Prep (Lines 1001–1130)
- **User** captured the integration transcript showing lint → unit → integration successes (pending export test acknowledged); **Copilot** confirmed docs/code/tests were intact and declared T046 ready for commit.
- **Artifacts**: None—state stabilized for the user’s commit.
- **Learning**: Full verify logs provide audit evidence before handoff.

## Turn 10: Roadmap Replan & Dogfooding Pitch (Lines 1131–1220)
- **User** committed T046 and requested fresh options or dogfooding concepts; **Copilot** proposed T059 drift history, T047 AI insights, and a symbol neighbor explorer inspired by the user’s pain searching for related symbols.
- **Artifacts**: None; planning conversation only.
- **Learning**: Live developer friction (manual symbol searches) shaped the next feature slate.

## Turn 11: Spec Expansion for Symbol Neighbors (Lines 1221–1290)
- **User** asked to embed the new user story in the spec; **Copilot** added US4 “Maintainers explore symbol neighborhoods” plus FR-018 to `spec.md`, defining hop-limited traversal as a platform goal.
- **Artifacts**: `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md` updated with US4 and FR-018.
- **Learning**: Specs remain the single source of truth for new dogfood stories before implementation starts.

## Turn 12: Spec Suite Alignment (Lines 1291–1420)
- **User** requested verification across related docs; **Copilot** propagated US4 into `plan.md` (new Phase 6), `tasks.md` (T063–T067 backlog, T046 marked complete), and `quickstart.md` (documenting the Inspect Symbol Neighbors workflow).
- **Artifacts**: Updated plan/tasks/quickstart under `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/`.
- **Learning**: Cross-document hygiene ensures traceability from roadmap to onboarding guides.

## Turn 13: T059 Discovery & Drift History Doc Pass (Lines 1421–1530)
- **User** green-lit T059; **Copilot** hydrated MDMD (`language-server-architecture`, runtime docs) and created `.mdmd/layer-4/server-telemetry/driftHistoryStore.mdmd.md`, outlining storage needs and query APIs.
- **Artifacts**: New layer-4 telemetry doc; initial graphStore type adjustments.
- **Learning**: Telemetry modules now have dedicated MDMD coverage before code is written.

## Turn 14: GraphStore Enhancements & Status Check (Lines 1531–1620)
- **Copilot** extended `graphStore.ts` and domain types to map drift history rows, updated shared exports, and ensured typed results; `npm run verify` went green (with the known pending test). When asked about readiness, the agent enumerated remaining gaps (runtime store wiring, emission hooks, restart tests).
- **Artifacts**: `packages/shared/src/db/graphStore.ts`, `.mdmd` additions; no runtime wiring yet.
- **Learning**: Early verification confirms schema changes compile while highlighting unfinished integration work.

## Turn 15: Drift History Implementation Phase (Lines 1621–1850)
- **User** authorized the remaining steps; **Copilot** implemented `packages/server/src/telemetry/driftHistoryStore.ts`, wired it through `acknowledgementService.ts`, added unit coverage, and updated integration harness imports while iterating on lint/unit runs.
- **Artifacts**: New telemetry module, acknowledgement service updates, export adjustments, test rewrites.
- **Learning**: Persistence logic required both emission and acknowledgement paths to log drift history events atomically.

## Turn 16: Integration Failures & Environment Fixes (Lines 1851–2000)
- **User** ran integration tests—SQLite failed due to missing directories. **Copilot** patched `acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts` to ensure the database path exists but subsequent runs still hit “unable to open database file,” signaling further work ahead.
- **Artifacts**: Integration test updated to pre-create drift history storage directory.
- **Learning**: New persistence paths must respect test-mode storage overrides; directory readiness alone didn’t solve the issue, prompting deeper investigation.

## Turn 17: Awaiting Drift History DB Creation (Lines 2001–2080)
- **Copilot** enhanced the integration test to poll for the drift history database before opening it, but the next run still failed—this time surfacing the precise path that never materialized.
- **Artifacts**: `acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts` updated with wait logic.
- **Learning**: Timing alone wasn’t the culprit; the server could be writing to multiple potential storage roots.

## Turn 18: Multi-Path Lookup & Green Tests (Lines 2081–2180)
- **Copilot** analyzed server storage resolution and updated the test to search all plausible drift-history locations (configured storage dir, workspace fallback, OS temp). Integration tests then passed; the agent summarized the drift history work, updated docs/tasks, and suggested a commit message.
- **Artifacts**: Revised `acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts`, MDMD and SpecKit updates marking T059 complete.
- **Learning**: Resilient test harnesses must mirror runtime fallback logic when multiple storage paths exist.

## Turn 19: Post-T059 Roadmap Refresh (Lines 2181–2250)
- **User** confirmed `npm run verify` success and asked for the next top priorities; **Copilot** recommended T047 (AI analysis command) and US4 tasks T063–T066, positioning the symbol neighbor work as next.
- **Artifacts**: None (planning only).
- **Learning**: With drift history shipped, focus shifted to delivering the newly documented dogfood workflow.

## Turn 20: Symbol Neighbor Service Foundations (Lines 2251–2400)
- **User** chose T063–T065; **Copilot** reviewed dependencies contracts, graphStore helpers, and specs before creating `symbolNeighbors.ts` plus its unit test, extending shared contracts with the new request/response shapes.
- **Artifacts**: `packages/server/src/features/dependencies/symbolNeighbors.{ts,test.ts}`, `packages/shared/src/contracts/symbols.ts`, graphStore confidence augmentation.
- **Learning**: Hop-limited traversal required confidence metadata from graphStore to produce meaningful rankings.

## Turn 21: Unit Validation & Summary (Lines 2401–2470)
- **Copilot** ran `npm run test:unit`, reviewed diffs, and outlined remaining steps (server wiring + VS Code command); unit tests passed.
- **Artifacts**: Test run logs; no new files.
- **Learning**: Early unit coverage guarded traversal invariants before wiring the LSP surface.

## Turn 22: MDMD Audit for New Surfaces (Lines 2471–2580)
- **User** asked for MDMD verification; **Copilot** audited layer-4 docs, identified missing coverage for symbolNeighbors, graphStore, and symbols contracts, and proposed adding documentation with explicit test references.
- **Artifacts**: Planning notes for new MDMD files.
- **Learning**: Every new implementation file should have a dedicated layer-4 doc capturing its contract and tests.

## Turn 23: Documentation Expansion (Lines 2581–2700)
- **User** approved; **Copilot** authored `.mdmd/layer-4/dependencies/symbolNeighbors.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/shared/graphStore.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/shared-contracts/symbolsContracts.mdmd.md`, and refreshed the layer-3 architecture doc to reference the new route and tests.
- **Artifacts**: New and updated MDMD files with test mappings and rationale.
- **Learning**: Layer-4 docs now reflect symbol neighbor traversal, shared schemas, and their coverage sources.

## Turn 24: LSP & Command Implementation Kickoff (Lines 2701–3000)
- **User** directed the agent to wire the service through the LSP and build the VS Code quick pick; **Copilot** updated server routing, extension entry points, dependency quick pick, and created shared artifact schemas alongside command/unit/integration tests and new MDMD doc for the quick pick. Builds, unit tests, and integration tests ran during the process.
- **Artifacts**: Updates across `packages/server/src/main.ts`, `packages/extension/{package.json,src/extension.ts,src/diagnostics/dependencyQuickPick.ts}`, new command/test files, shared schemas, `tests/integration/us4/inspectSymbolNeighbors.test.ts`, MDMD quick pick doc.
- **Learning**: Delivering the dogfood experience required coordinated updates across shared contracts, server handlers, extension commands, and documentation.

## Turn 25: Integration Regression & Empty-State Failure (Lines 3001–3280)
- **User** ran `npm run verify`; 16 integration specs passed but the US4 quick-pick scenario failed because the command reported an empty state, while the extension host spammed schema-validation errors complaining about missing artifact URIs/IDs in the static knowledge feeds.
- **Copilot** reviewed the integration harness, rewrote `tests/integration/us4/inspectSymbolNeighbors.test.ts` to assert on the Quick Pick UI instead of empty messaging, and noted that the feed ingestion path likely needed format detection fixes.
- **Learning**: Adjusting test expectations without repairing the upstream feed schema left the feature broken—knowledge ingestion must succeed before UI behavior can stabilize.

## Turn 26: Feed Format Hardening & Persistent Timeouts (Lines 3281–3520)
- **User** re-ran the suite and surfaced new logs: the US4 command still timed out and the extension host continued emitting ingestion warnings; other suites started failing because diagnostics never appeared.
- **Copilot** tightened `feedFormatDetector.ts` to treat JSON snapshots without URIs as legacy feeds, added regression coverage, and refreshed the integration spec expecting the Quick Pick to fire; local unit/integration runs appeared green from Copilot’s vantage point, but the user’s terminal still showed the timeout.
- **Learning**: We uncovered a visibility gap—Copilot’s automation reports success even while the user’s run continues, so fixes must be confirmed against the user’s ground truth before declaring victory.

## Turn 27: GraphStore Dedupe Attempt & New Failures (Lines 3521–4000)
- **User** highlighted continuing failures plus new SQLite `UNIQUE` violations on `artifacts.uri` and `links.*`, then later pointed out unit regressions once Copilot’s edits landed.
- **Copilot** refactored `packages/shared/src/db/graphStore.ts` to reuse canonical artifact/link IDs, updated `saveDocumentChange.ts` and `overrideLink.ts` to honor the stored records, and introduced `graphStore.test.ts`; unit and integration runs were reported as passing despite the user still seeing conflicts.
- **Learning**: The dedupe work uncovered missing named parameters and null artifact returns in tests, signaling that the data model adjustments need deeper validation before they can be trusted.

## Turn 28: Feed Ingest Errors & Quick Pick Timeouts (Lines 4001–4700)
- **User** reran integration tests and surfaced new telemetry: knowledge feeds now loaded but the Inspect Symbol Neighbors spec still failed—sometimes timing out, other times asserting that the quick pick never appeared; unit tests also flagged missing `storedArtifact.id` values.
- **Copilot** tightened alias cleanup in `knowledgeGraphBridge.ts`, patched feed format detection, and kept iterating on graphStore dedupe while attempting to stub VS Code’s `showQuickPick` inside the integration test using `Object.defineProperty`; the command continued to hang, proving the override never stuck.
- **Learning**: Stabilizing persistence removed the SQLite errors, but the VS Code UI still required deterministic automation—stubbing framework proxies demanded deeper tooling than a simple property assignment.

## Turn 29: Stub Infrastructure & Proxy Discovery (Lines 4701–5600)
- **User** noted the quick pick UI still appeared even when Copilot claimed the stub worked, confirming real interactions were required; Copilot spelunked `.vscode-test` logs, decompiled transpiled bundles, and experimented with `Reflect.set` to replace window methods, yet the test kept oscillating between timeout and failed assertions.
- **To unblock automation**, Copilot introduced `packages/extension/src/testing/testHooks.ts`, updated the extension entry point to register test doubles, and rewired the integration spec to assert that the stub actually executed while simulating a user selection; additional safeguards stubbed `showInformationMessage` and `showErrorMessage` so any unexpected UI would fail fast.
- **Learning**: Reliable integration tests needed explicit hooks baked into the extension rather than ad-hoc monkey patches—once those hooks existed, the suite could drive the command deterministically.

## Turn 30: Green Pipeline & Release Wrap-Up (Lines 5601–6577)
- **User** triggered `npm run verify`; lint, unit, and integration suites finally went green with the quick pick automation in place, and the extension host log showed “Command executes… (257ms)” instead of a timeout.
- **Copilot** refreshed `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/tasks.md` to mark T063–T066 complete, summarized the day’s edits in `2025-10-23.md`, and committed the change-set with `feat: ship symbol neighbor explorer and harden graph persistence` after staging updated docs, code, and chat history.
- **Learning**: Persistent instrumentation plus dedicated test hooks delivered a stable end-to-end dogfood path, confirming the symbol neighbor workflow and graph persistence are now production-ready.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- Coordinated doc-first development kept MDMD, specs, and tasks synchronized with each implementation tranche.
- Telemetry and persistence hardening (noise suppression metrics, drift history, graph dedupe) ensured new features produced trustworthy data.
- Integration observability via test hooks, feed readiness logs, and deterministic quick pick stubs converted flaky UI flows into automatable scenarios.
- Knowledge ingestion resilience improved by supporting legacy feed snapshots and canonicalizing artifacts/links across sources.
- End-to-end dogfooding focus tied every change back to maintainer workflows, validating the symbol neighbor exploration loop.

## Salient Decisions Ratified
1. Ship noise suppression (T046) before expanding telemetry so ripple signals stay actionable once drift history arrives.
2. Persist drift history via the shared graphStore to guarantee acknowledgements and future analytics share a single source of truth.
3. Embed explicit test hooks in the extension rather than monkey-patching VS Code APIs so integration specs remain reliable.
4. Deduplicate artifacts and links at ingestion time to eliminate SQLite uniqueness faults and protect cross-feed merges.

## Next Phase
- Pick up T067 to extend symbol neighbor insights into CLI instrumentation and supporting workflow documentation.
- Backfill analytics dashboards that consume the new drift history and noise metrics for maintainers.
- Revisit export diagnostics metadata wiring so the pending acknowledgement integration test can be unskipped.
- Dogfood the symbol neighbor explorer on larger workspaces to validate scalability and identify remaining UX gaps.
