---

## Turn 01: Resume 10/29 Summary Cleanup (Lines 1–120)
- **User** asked to finish the unsummarized tail of 10/29 following the standard dev-history prompt.
- **Copilot** reread the prior summaries/log slices and appended the missing turns to `2025-10-29.SUMMARIZED.md`.
- **Artifacts**: `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-29.SUMMARIZED.md` updated with new turns.
- **Learning**: Daily recaps must honor the 1,200-line piton workflow to avoid autosummarization churn.

## Turn 02: Add Commit Crosswalk (Lines 121–200)
- **User** provided the latest git log and required commit ↔ turn mapping inside the 10/29 summary.
- **Copilot** inserted a “Commit Crosswalk” section enumerating commits `59f78996…` and `32b506c…` with their turn coverage.
- **Artifacts**: Updated `2025-10-29.SUMMARIZED.md` header + commit section.
- **Learning**: Recaps stay auditable only when they reference authoritative git metadata.

## Turn 03: Extract 10/29 MDMD Signals (Lines 201–420)
- **User** invoked the mdmd.extract prompt for 10/29.
- **Copilot** reviewed existing layer signal archives, generated `2025-10-29.layer{1–4}.md`, and began populating them from the raw log segments.
- **Artifacts**: New files under `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/MDMD-Signals/layer-{1..4}/`.
- **Learning**: Layer-specific signal files require chunked ingestion and rehydration whenever autosummarization occurs.

## Turn 04: Rehydrate Post-Autosummarization (Lines 421–600)
- **User** highlighted another lossy window and directed Copilot to resume at line 2401.
- **Copilot** reread the relevant slices and finished backfilling the layer signal files with late-day directives (lead-developer mandate, workspace scope, ASCII storytelling).
- **Artifacts**: Updated `2025-10-29.layer{1..4}.md` with ownership and tiered-adoption guidance.
- **Learning**: Persisting progress to disk between pitons prevents data loss during autosummarization resets.

## Turn 05: Reground the Project Narrative (Lines 601–760)
- **User** requested a contiguous story of the project to refresh context ahead of ideation.
- **Copilot** summarised Dev Days 1–13, tracing milestones from SpecKit scaffolding through ripple diagnostics, SlopCop expansion, and the new docstring-bridge vision.
- **Artifacts**: Chat recap only.
- **Learning**: Routine narrative refreshes keep intent clear as the roadmap evolves.

## Turn 06: Deepen Symbol-Correctness Plan (Lines 761–930)
- **User** pressed for a more grounded answer based on actual summaries/specs.
- **Copilot** reread key docs (vision, roadmap, spec) and articulated “Symbol Correctness Profiles” bridging MDMD layers, outlining graph/validator/tooling changes and phased adoption.
- **Artifacts**: None yet; plan captured in chat for future work.
- **Learning**: Profile-driven enforcement lets users recreate MDMD guarantees while staying configurable.

## Turn 07: Map Practical Next Steps (Lines 931–1030)
- **User** asked for actionable tasks to reach layered symbol correctness.
- **Copilot** proposed adding structured metadata/front matter, drafting a profile schema, updating the Phase 9 backlog, and building validators/tests to enforce upstream/downstream links.
- **Artifacts**: Planning notes only.
- **Learning**: Bridging vision to execution starts with documenting required metadata and backlog changes before writing validators.

## Turn 08: Replace Front Matter with Metadata Sections (Lines 1031–1200)
- **User** cautioned against introducing YAML front matter and advocated for layer-specific instructions.
- **Copilot** converted the proposal to explicit `## Metadata` sections, created `.github/instructions/mdmd.layer{1..4}.instructions.md`, updated the Layer 1 vision doc to the new format, and mandated heading-based capability symbols.
- **Artifacts**: New/updated instruction files; revised `link-aware-diagnostics-vision.mdmd.md`.
- **Learning**: Standardising metadata via headings keeps docs machine-parseable without adding new parsers.

## Turn 09: Run Audits and Harmonise Initial Docs (Lines 1201–1430)
- **User** executed graph snapshot/audit and SlopCop suites, exposing broken MDMD links and duplicate slug warnings across Layer 2–4.
- **Copilot** inventoried docs, created `inferenceAccuracyTracker.mdmd.md`, and rewired key Layer 2/3/4 files (product roadmap, falsifiability suite, doc diagnostics) to the metadata + heading template while fixing link targets; reran `slopcop:markdown`, `slopcop:symbols`, and `graph:audit`.
- **Artifacts**: Numerous `.mdmd` updates; new telemetry doc; updated shared references.
- **Learning**: Converting exported symbols to headings plus repairing cross-links immediately sharpens lint signals, though unit-test docs still lack coverage.

## Turn 10: Broaden Template Adoption (Lines 1431–1640)
- **User** asked for deeper harmonisation.
- **Copilot** reread layer instructions, realigned additional Layer 4 docs (CLI, commands, services), and tightened analyzer references to shared contracts, confirming markdown lint stayed green.
- **Artifacts**: Updated Layer 4 doc set including inspectSymbolNeighbors CLI and symbol bridge.
- **Learning**: Enforcing metadata + heading symbols across tooling surfaces ensures SlopCop can police link accuracy automatically.

## Turn 11: Continue Layer 4 Migration & Link Repairs (Lines 1641–1980)
- **User** endorsed the plan; Copilot migrated more Layer 4 implementations (watchers, knowledge feeds, schema validator) to the new format, refreshed collaborating Layer 3 docs, and added evidence references.
- **Artifacts**: Updated `artifactWatcher.mdmd.md`, knowledge ingestion docs, and feed checkpoint store metadata.
- **Learning**: Systematic Layer 4 refactors reveal stale evidence links and missing test references, forcing documentation to reflect real coverage.

## Turn 12: Rehydrations & Ongoing Validation (Lines 1981–2160)
- **User** repeatedly supplied context snippets to counter autosummarization while running full suites (graph snapshot/audit, SlopCop, fixtures).
- **Copilot** fixed link breakage, redirected metadata references, and catalogued the outstanding symbol coverage gaps reported by audits.
- **Artifacts**: Further `.mdmd` link corrections; fixture tooling outputs captured in chat.
- **Learning**: Frequent rehydration plus full-pipeline runs keep the harmonisation work honest—any missing anchors show up immediately in SlopCop and graph audits.

## Turn 13: Address Symbol Coverage Regressions (Lines 2161–2400)
- **User** shared comprehensive audit results showing significant symbol coverage regressions and broken anchors.
- **Copilot** revisited Layer 3/4 docs to add missing anchor sections, aligned implementation headings with component IDs, and reinstated evidence links to the correct test suites, preparing for another audit cycle.
- **Artifacts**: Updated knowledge ingestion, extension surfaces, diagnostics pipeline, and workspace snapshot docs.
- **Learning**: Harmonisation must include bidirectional anchors—Layer 4 headings must match Layer 3 references exactly to satisfy the symbol validator.

## Turn 14: Restore Knowledge-Graph Slug Consistency (Lines 2401–2590)
- **User** wanted the lingering SlopCop symbol warnings cleared while Layer 4 migrations continued.
- **Copilot** adjusted `language-server-architecture.mdmd.md` to list `IMP-205 knowledgeGraphIngestor` and normalised the Layer 4 anchors (`artifactWatcher`, `knowledgeGraphIngestor`, `inspectSymbolNeighborsCli`, `workspaceGraphSnapshot`) to the hyphenless GitHub slug format.
- **Artifacts**: Updated `.mdmd/layer-3/language-server-architecture.mdmd.md` and the related Layer 4 docs.
- **Learning**: Our symbol audit mirrors GitHub’s slugger; any doc-export mismatch resurfaces immediately.

## Turn 15: Rehydrate & Revalidate After Autosummarization (Lines 245–2754)
- **User** requested a re-read of the Oct 30 transcript chunk (lines 245‑2602) before proceeding.
- **Copilot** reread the specified slices, reran `npm run graph:audit`, `npm run slopcop:markdown`, and `npm run slopcop:symbols`, and catalogued the open gaps: three code artifacts lacking docs, nine Layer 3 files without downstream relationships, and symbol coverage at 364/426.
- **Artifacts**: None beyond tool outputs; plan captured in chat (finish Layer 4 migrations, document straggler tests, tighten graph snapshot logic).
- **Learning**: Frequent piton reads plus full-tool sweeps keep migrations honest after lossy context resets.

## Turn 16: Expand Knowledge-Graph Implementation Coverage (Lines 2755–2980)
- **User** greenlit high-agency progress on Layer 4 migrations.
- **Copilot** audited Layer 4 metadata compliance, brought `knowledgeGraphBridge.mdmd.md`, `knowledgeFeedManager.mdmd.md`, `feedFormatDetector.mdmd.md`, `schemaValidator.mdmd.md`, `workspaceIndexProvider.mdmd.md`, and `symbolBridgeProvider.mdmd.md` onto the new template, and linked each back into `knowledge-graph-ingestion.mdmd.md` via fresh IMP entries.
- **Artifacts**: Multiple `.mdmd/layer-4/knowledge-graph-ingestion/*.mdmd.md` files plus the Layer 3 aggregator doc.
- **Learning**: Each implementation doc now exposes `Metadata`, `Code Path`, and evidence so Layer 3 components can inherit consistent relationships once the pipeline supports it.

## Turn 17: Teach Snapshot Ingestion About Layer Metadata (Lines 2981–3380)
- **User** supplied additional transcript ranges and tooling outputs to ensure the snapshot constraints stay aligned.
- **Copilot** upgraded `workspaceIndexProvider.ts` to parse layer-specific `identifiers`, recognise section symbols, and emit them in the workspace snapshot; refactored `audit-doc-coverage.ts` to trust metadata + `Public Symbols` headings instead of inline code blocks; and reran graph snapshot/audit + SlopCop suites (markdown/symbols clean, audit now showing 372/426 documented exports with expanded MDMD gaps).
- **Artifacts**: `packages/server/src/features/knowledge/workspaceIndexProvider.ts`, `scripts/graph-tools/audit-doc-coverage.ts`, refreshed `data/graph-snapshots/workspace.snapshot.json`.
- **Learning**: The ingestion pipeline now emits stable `identifiers`, but stronger rules expose real documentation debt—fewer false positives at the cost of more visible gaps.

## Turn 18: Clarify MDMD Scope & Tool Responsibilities (Lines 3381–3465)
- **User** asked why the server knew about MDMD and how `graph:audit` differs from `slopcop:symbols`.
- **Copilot** confirmed the MDMD-aware indexer lives in the language server (not the shipped extension) to power local audits, and contrasted SlopCop’s markdown-structure checks with `graph:audit`’s cross-artifact symbol validation.
- **Artifacts**: None; architectural rationale recorded in chat.
- **Learning**: Clear separation between shipped extension behaviour and internal tooling lets us evolve doc conventions without polluting the runtime.

## Turn 19: Document Straggler Tests & Align CLI Exports (Lines 3466–3758)
- **User** queried how test files became documentation orphans and authorised additional debt paydown.
- **Copilot** created Layer 4 docs for the outstanding unit tests (`docDiagnosticProviderTests`, `publishDocDiagnosticsTests`) and the `mdmd-layer-audit` tool, then rewired the CLI scripts (`audit-doc-coverage.ts`, `inspect-symbol.ts`, `snapshot-workspace.ts`, `mdmd-layer-audit.ts`) to export the functions their docs promise (`parseArgs`, `main`, etc.).
- **Artifacts**: New `.mdmd/layer-4/testing/unit/*.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/tooling/mdmdLayerAudit.mdmd.md`, plus updated CLI sources.
- **Learning**: Keeping Layer 4 docs authoritative forces their sibling CLIs to expose real entry points, reducing doc/code drift.

## Turn 20: Resolve Link Targets & Slug Collisions (Lines 3759–4090)
- **User** surfaced SlopCop link errors against the new docs and symbol audit anchor mismatches.
- **Copilot** shifted the test docs to workspace-absolute links, restored GitHub-compatible headings in the Layer 3 specs, corrected fragment slugs like `comp001-diagnostics-pipeline`, and revalidated with `slopcop:markdown`/`slopcop:symbols` (clean) while `graph:audit` still flagged structural gaps.
- **Artifacts**: Updated `.mdmd/layer-4/testing/unit/*.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-3/{diagnostics-pipeline,extension-surfaces,language-server-architecture}.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/tooling/mdmdLayerAudit.mdmd.md`.
- **Learning**: Absolute links are fine—the real hazard is relying on manual `<a id>` tags instead of letting GitHub slugging dictate anchors.

## Turn 21: Link Layer 3 Docs Directly to Layer 4 (Lines 4091–4320)
- **User** pressed for tangible fixes rather than repeated lint runs, and Copilot bulk-added workspace-absolute `Linked Implementations` entries across all nine Layer 3 architecture docs.
- **Tools**: `npm run graph:snapshot`, `npm run graph:audit`, `npm run slopcop:(markdown|symbols)`.
- **Outcome**: Markdown and symbol lint stayed green, but the audit still complained because Layer 3 → Layer 4 links don’t yet propagate to code artifacts.
- **Learning**: Manual crosslinks alone can’t satisfy the audit; the graph must understand how documentation layers compose.

## Turn 22: Diagnose Audit Failures & Choose Rule-Engine Direction (Lines 4321–4595)
- **User** asked for systematic options and a root-cause explanation.
- **Copilot** detailed why Layer 3 docs appear orphaned (audit insists on reaching code) and compared potential solutions (inheritance, direct code links, intermediate artifacts, ignores, automation).
- **Decision**: Align on a declarative “glob-to-glob” relationship rule engine so MDMD (or any doc scheme) becomes configuration-driven rather than hard-coded.
- **Learning**: Treating documentation/computation as plain-text globs with enforced link chains preserves traceability while staying extensible for other workspaces.

## Turn 23: Scaffold Relationship Rule Engine & Docs (Lines 4596–5050)
- **User** instructed Copilot to start from documentation, then implement.
- **Copilot** rehydrated instructions, authored new MDMD artifacts (`.mdmd/layer-3/relationship-rule-engine.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/tooling/relationshipRuleEngine.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/tooling/relationshipRuleAudit.mdmd.md`), and laid down the initial runtime scaffolding: `link-relationship-rules.json`, `relationshipRuleTypes.ts`, `relationshipResolvers.ts`, and `relationshipRuleEngine.ts`.
- **Artifacts**: New configuration + shared rule modules; docs describing the planned rule engine and audit surfaces.
- **Learning**: Document-first scaffolding keeps the impending rule engine aligned with MDMD conventions before code solidifies.

## Turn 24: Ship Relationship Rules Upgrade (Lines 5051–5440)
- **User** signalled an implementation hiccup; Copilot fixed the nesting bug in `relationshipRuleEngine.ts`, then delivered the end-to-end upgrade.
- **Work**: Added `pathUtils.ts`, `relationshipRuleProvider.ts` (+ tests + Layer 4 doc), `relationshipRuleAudit.ts`, wired the provider into `snapshot-workspace.ts` and `server/src/main.ts`, exported everything via `shared/index.ts`, and documented each component (`relationshipRuleResolvers|Types|Provider.mdmd.md`, `pathUtils.mdmd.md`).
- **Validation**: `npm run build`, `npm run test:unit` (after resolving the initial compilation error).
- **Learning**: With the provider emitting `documents`/`implements` edges, relationship rules now participate in both snapshots and live server inference.

## Turn 25: Convert Layer 3 Docs to Markdown Links & Regenerate Evidences (Lines 5441–5710)
- **User** provided audit output still showing orphaned Layer 3 docs and SlopCop anchor errors.
- **Copilot** updated `link-relationship-rules.json` to chase Layer 3 → Layer 4 → code chains, converted all affected Layer 4 docs from `Code Path` text to markdown links, fixed `COMP-010/011` slug collisions, reran snapshot/audit/SlopCop, and verified 486 rule-derived evidences with no documentation gaps remaining (symbol coverage still ~88 %).
- **Learning**: Relationship rules now materialise documentation edges automatically; maintaining Markdown links in Layer 4 is the only authoring requirement.

## Turn 26: Add Symbol-Correctness Profiles & Wire Them Into Audits (Lines 5711–6120)
- **User** ran `safe:commit`, revealing the new rule modules lacked documentation and symbol profile support.
- **Copilot** authored docs for `symbolCorrectnessProfiles` and `symbolCorrectnessValidator`, extended the Layer 1/2 vision + roadmap, generated `symbolCorrectnessProfiles.ts` and `server/.../symbolCorrectnessValidator.ts`, re-exported the APIs via `shared/index.ts`, and augmented `audit-doc-coverage.ts` to load profiles, emit JSON/text diagnostics, and surface profile violations alongside existing coverage checks.
- **Validation**: `npm run build`; subsequent `safe:commit` run passed verify/tests but graph audit highlighted remaining symbol coverage gaps (423/495 documented) and new MDMD references to align.
- **Learning**: The audit pipeline now enforces configurable symbol profiles, but the backlog of undocumented exports is the next blocker to turning the suite fully green.

## Turn 27: Harden Relationship Rule Provider Tests (Lines 6121–6420)
- **User** kept the focus on stabilising the new relationship-rule pipeline while Copilot continued aligning docs and tests.
- **Copilot** reread the rule engine/provider sources, rewrote `relationshipRuleProvider.test.ts` so it mirrors the markdown-link chain fixture (correct Layer 3 doc path, explicit `documents` evidence), and added guard assertions that the compiled rule emits no warnings, every hop finds candidates, and both resolvers succeed; reran the targeted and full `npm run test:unit` suites to confirm.
- **Artifacts**: Updated `packages/shared/src/rules/relationshipRuleProvider.test.ts` and related fixture references.
- **Learning**: The test now captures the full resolver chain, so future rule tweaks cannot silently drop evidences.

## Turn 28: Close Symbol Coverage Gaps via Layer 4 Docs (Lines 6421–7040)
- **User** shared a failing `npm run safe:commit` log—graph audit still reported 85 % symbol coverage plus a missing Layer 3→code propagation rule.
- **Copilot** rehydrated the earlier conversation slices, reread the MDMD instruction set, and embarked on a documentation sweep: refreshed `relationshipExtractor.mdmd.md`, `relationshipRuleAudit.mdmd.md`, `inferenceAccuracyTracker.mdmd.md`, created new Ollama tooling briefs, and linked `relationship-rule-engine.mdmd.md` directly to its implementation; iterative `graph:snapshot`/`graph:audit` runs now report 495/495 documented exports with the propagation rule satisfied.
- **Artifacts**: Numerous `.mdmd` updates including `.mdmd/layer-4/tooling/{relationshipRuleEngine,relationshipRuleAudit,ollamaClient,ollamaEndpoint,ollamaMock}.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/telemetry/inferenceAccuracyTracker.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-3/relationship-rule-engine.mdmd.md`.
- **Learning**: Treating each exported type as a documented heading forces the audits to 100 % coverage while validating that Layer 3 architecture docs map straight to code.

## Turn 29: Fix Slug & Link Regressions; Safe Commit Passes (Lines 7041–7440)
- **User** reran `safe:commit`; lint/tests/fixtures passed, but SlopCop flagged a malformed `/`-prefixed link and symbol names that collided with their document titles.
- **Copilot** corrected the relationship-rule link target, reran `slopcop:markdown`, and tidied the remaining slug issues—retargeted the Layer 1 roadmap anchor to GitHub’s `req040` slug and renamed `RelationshipExtractor`/`GraphStore` headings to “(class)” so the symbol audit dropped its duplicates—before repeating `slopcop:symbols` and the full `safe:commit` pipeline (all green).
- **Artifacts**: Adjusted `.mdmd/layer-3/relationship-rule-engine.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-4/server-diagnostics/symbolCorrectnessValidator.mdmd.md`, `.mdmd/layer-1/link-aware-diagnostics-vision.mdmd.md`, plus heading tweaks across affected docs.
- **Learning**: Final polishing relied on matching GitHub slug semantics exactly; once the anchors aligned, the entire pre-commit suite reported clean.
