## Turn 1: Initial Vision & API Strategy (Lines 1–159)

**User Request**: How to build a system raising IntelliSense problems when docs and code that reference each other diverge? Interested in two paths: (1) markdown layers ↔ implementation files; (2) cross-file code references based on AST.

**Copilot Response**: Searched VS Code APIs for diagnostics, file watchers, and dependency tracking. Proposed treating docs/code as nodes in a dependency graph, using `workspace.createFileSystemWatcher`, `languages.createDiagnosticCollection`, and registering `DiagnosticRelatedInformation` to show cross-file links. Suggested encoding relationships via metadata or heuristic discovery; offered a prototype sketch using `validatePair` to compare hashes/semantic data and emit diagnostics conditionally.

**Learnings**: User's 4-layer markdown model (vision → requirements → architecture → implementation) requires explicit graph structure. Language Server Protocol was identified as the appropriate backbone for scaling beyond VS Code.

---

## Turn 2: LSP vs. Extension Trade-off (Lines 160–248)

**User Request**: Determine whether to build an LSP backend or a pure VS Code extension, noting Copilot's weakness in extension development when new windows raise (context is lost).

**Copilot Response**: Compared both approaches. **VS Code Extension**: fast prototyping, offline, simpler debugging, but can block the extension host under heavy work and harder to reuse outside VS Code. **Language Server (LSP)**: keeps analysis in a separate process, avoids UI blocking, reusable across editors, but adds multi-component distribution complexity. **Recommendation**: Opt for LSP now to validate long-term architecture and work around Copilot's extension context limitations.

**Learnings**: User's choice to pursue LSP was strategic—it permits reuse and sidesteps the IDE context-window problem.

---

## Turn 3: Polyglot AST & Parser Tiers (Lines 249–345)

**User Request**: Given that Copilot must be polyglot-aware, how can we handle languages without perfect AST support? Mention LLM-derived ASTs, but keep lightweight. Recommend a graph DB approach.

**Copilot Response**: Described a **Tier 0/1/2 parser strategy**: top-tier languages use Tree-sitter/mature parsers; others fall back to rule-based enrichment; exotic stacks get LLM extraction with confidence scores. Recommended **SQLite property graphs** (proven by SCIP/LSIF) for simplicity and portability; suggested KùzuDB only if richer query patterns emerge. Introduced the idea that an LLM with a 32k token window could walk the graph on-demand, deciding impact ripples. Proposed caching embeddings and allowing LLM-driven "expand node X" tool calls to keep context tractable.

**Learnings**: Confidence scoring and provenance tracking (parser vs. LLM) are essential; graph storage can stay lightweight if nodes always carry accurate spans.

---

## Turn 4: Riding Official VS Code APIs (Lines 346–420)

**User Request**: What can VS Code APIs provide so we don't reinvent wheel? How do we consume improvements as they arrive?

**Copilot Response**: Detailed native VS Code leverage points: (1) `languages.onDidChangeDiagnostics` + `languages.getDiagnostics()` let you subscribe to other servers' output without re-parsing. (2) `commands.executeCommand('vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider', uri)` and related `execute*Provider` commands proxy to active language servers for symbols, definitions, references, and call graphs. (3) `workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument`, `createFileSystemWatcher`, and semantic tokens APIs expose file events and language-server semantic data. Endorsed LSIF/SCIP index consumption for offline seeding. Stressed modular LSP design so third-party server improvements flow automatically into the graph via the ingestion layer.

**Learnings**: **Core insight**: piggyback on continuously improving language servers rather than compete with them. Keep the ingestion layer modular so graph benefits from upstream updates automatically.

---

## Turn 5: LLM Access Strategy & vscode.lm (Lines 346–420 continued)

**User Request**: Research best approach to access LLM for the LSP. Does VS Code expose settings for local Ollama? Should we assume a running instance?

**Copilot Response**: Announced that VS Code 1.91+ exposes `vscode.lm.requestChat` and `vscode.lm.selectChatModels`, abstracting away whether models are remote (Azure OpenAI, Copilot) or local (Ollama, LM Studio). Noted `machine.learning` settings namespace with Ollama defaults (`localhost:11434`). Proposed keeping the language server agnostic by having the **client** (VS Code extension) handle `vscode.lm` calls, while the LSP backend defines custom requests. Optional adapters: Ollama REST or OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Stressed that avoiding Ollama lock-in means riding improvements as VS Code adds new providers.

**Learnings**: Delegate LLM calls to the client, respect user consent/auth, cache responses with provenance, and stay provider-agnostic to benefit from future platform evolution.

---

## Turn 6: Consent, Cost, and Background Usage (Lines 346–420 continued)

**User Request**: Elaborate on cost implications, background chat sessions, and liabilities when requesting LLM responses on behalf of users.

**Copilot Response**: Clarified that `vscode.lm` calls consume user's Copilot quota/credits exactly as manual chat would. Documented required governance: (1) gate feature behind settings (default off or prompt), (2) label cloud vs. local model usage, (3) surface usage telemetry to users. Discussed "Bring Your Own Key" providers and need for explicit consent before sending proprietary code. Noted legal/compliance requirements: GitHub Copilot Terms demand user consent; enterprise policies may forbid cloud model access. Recommended `local-only` mode as default for sensitive workspaces and persistent logging of every cloud LLM call for audit.

**Learnings**: Background LLM usage carries real cost and legal burden; transparency and consent are non-negotiable.

---

## Turn 7: Specification, Planning & Requirements (Lines 68–707)

**User Request**: Run `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, and `/speckit.analyze` to scaffold the feature spec and task breakdown.

**Copilot Response**: Executed SpecKit workflow: (1) Created `spec.md` documenting user stories (doc↔code sync, code dependency monitoring), functional/non-functional requirements, edge cases, success criteria, and assumptions. (2) Generated `plan.md` with phases (setup, foundations, user stories 1–3, hardening) and key deliverables. (3) Authored `tasks.md` with 38–47 sequential tasks across setup, maintenance, overrides, diagnostics, acknowledgements, and testing. Ran `/speckit.analyze` to identify gaps: missing settings toggles (FR-010), ricochet loop handling, delete/rename recovery, change batching, and performance instrumentation. Created `checklists/requirements.md` and `checklists/inference.md` for QA gates. All artifacts reference spec assumptions (inference-first, workspace-index regeneration, external schema contracts).

**Learnings**: Formal spec + planning discipline caught missing requirements (ricochet, settings, edge cases) before implementation; checklists serve as pre-implementation gates.

---

## Turn 8: Hysteresis, Ricochet, and Edge Cases (Lines 420–707)

**User Request**: How do we prevent doc→code→doc ricochet diagnostics? What about deletes and renames? Debouncing for multi-file Copilot edits?

**Copilot Response**: Proposed **hysteresis rule**: when artifact A triggers alert on B, further alerts from B→A are paused until acknowledgement or new edits post-acknowledgement. Documented file delete/rename recovery: auto-removal of links with UI prompts to rebind or prune. Specified change batching: debounce window (default 1s) buffers rapid edits before rebroadcasting diagnostics, respecting user's quiet-feedback expectations. Added requirements FR-011 (hysteresis), FR-012 (debounce), FR-013 (link repair). Expanded `tasks.md` with T033 (hysteresis controller), T020–T021 (file maintenance), T022–T023 (change queue and settings bridge).

**Learnings**: Ricochet suppression via acknowledgement state is essential; debounce + noise filters prevent churn and honour fast-feedback goal.

---

## Turn 9: Provider Selection Gate & Consent Clarity (Lines 737–842)

**User Request**: Clarify LLM provider selection logic. Should diagnostics be blocked until user chooses?

**Copilot Response**: Ran `/speckit.clarify`. Offered three options: A (default local-only, opt-in for cloud), B (auto mode respecting VS Code defaults), C (force provider selection on first run, block diagnostics until chosen). **User chose C**. Updated spec, plan, and tasks to enforce disabled diagnostics until explicit provider pick, with onboarding flow surfacing LLM options and consent warnings. Recorded the decision in spec clarifications log.

**Learnings**: Explicit provider selection enforces responsible AI governance and aligns with constitution principle (user autonomy over LLM usage).

---

## Turn 10: Inference-First Link Discovery (Lines 1000–1141)

**User Request**: Instead of front-matter metadata for links, adopt a VS Code workspace-index paradigm: auto-infer relationships from language servers, make the graph rebuildable like VS Code's own caches, and allow optional overrides.

**Copilot Response**: Reworked spec, plan, research, and tasks to describe link inference as primary (via `execute*Provider` and heuristics), overrides as exceptional. Updated FR-001: system infers links from language-server data and optional overrides; no mandatory front matter. Documented assumption: link graph is a disposable projection, rebuilt on-demand from workspace signals, just like VS Code's own indexes. Plan Phase 2 now covers link-inference orchestrator, incremental sync, and external feed ingestion. Updated quickstart to walk users through the inference flow, explaining that rebuilds happen automatically and cache deletion is safe.

**Learnings**: Inference-first + rebuildable-cache model decouples the system from manual annotation, mirrors VS Code's own infrastructure, and enables graceful degradation when external feeds are unavailable.

---

## Turn 11: Knowledge-Graph Schema & External Feeds (Lines 1320–1520)

**User Request**: Clarify how external knowledge-graph feeds (e.g., GitLab GKG) integrate. What schema/contract must they satisfy?

**Copilot Response**: Added FR-014 (knowledge-graph-backed monitoring) and FR-015 (external schema enforcement). Defined minimal contract: artifact id, edge type, direction, timestamp, confidence. Specified ingestion modes: (a) one-off snapshot imports, (b) long-lived subscription feeds. Documented failure scenarios: unreachable feeds fall back to local inference; stale/partial feeds trigger diagnostic warnings. Updated `knowledgeGraphBridge.ts` to normalise snapshots, handle streaming updates, and track checkpoints. Ensured overrides precedence rule (manual overrides > inferred > external feeds) is consistent everywhere.

**Learnings**: External feeds are additive optimizers; local inference remains the reliable baseline. Schema contracts and failure handling prevent cascading outages.

---

## Turn 12: AST-Backed Accuracy Testing (Lines 1600–1800)

**User Request**: We can verify our software's outputs against ground-truth ASTs of known codebases (e.g., C programs). Add this as a development-time validation mechanism, distinct from reproducibility checks.

**Copilot Response**: Added FR-016 (validate knowledge graph against ground-truth ASTs when available, fall back to self-similarity benchmarks otherwise). Extended spec edge cases: distinguish repos with canonical ASTs (C, curated samples) from those without (use self-similarity). Updated plan Phase 6 to introduce AST testbed with language coverage expectations and CI integration. Added tasks T060–T062: curate AST fixtures, implement comparison harness, wire both modes into CI. Positioned AST validation as a development-time QA tool (not runtime), enabling reproducibility audits and confidence-level tracking.

**Learnings**: Dual-mode benchmarking (AST comparison + self-similarity) lets us verify correctness against ground truth where available and measure stability where it's not.

---

## Turn 13: Implementation Bootstrap (Lines 2000–2523)

**User Request**: Execute `/speckit.implement`. Generate scaffolding: npm workspaces, TypeScript config, base package.json, extension and server stubs.

**Copilot Response**: Created workspace structure: root `package.json` with npm workspaces, `tsconfig.base.json`, ESLint flat config, debug/task profiles. Generated `packages/extension`, `packages/server`, `packages/shared` with initial `.ts` files. Scaffolded domain models (`Artifact`, `Link`, `ChangeEvent`), GraphStore SQLite interface, maintenance contracts, and override workflows. Wired extension.ts with command handlers and settings sync. Routed server main.ts through connection setup, document sync, and notification handlers. Implemented: (a) T020–T021: orphan cleanup + rebind prompts on delete/rename; (b) T022: change queue with debounce timer; (c) T023: settings bridge syncing config to runtime; (d) T024–T025: knowledge-graph ingestion contracts.

**Learnings**: Early scaffolding establishes clean module boundaries; tasks T020–T025 lock down maintenance plumbing before diagnostics logic lands.

---

## Turn 14: Lint, Type Safety & Runtime Fixes (Lines 2523–3586)

**User Request**: Resolve npm install issues (workspace: URL protocol), pin Node 20 for prebuilt binaries, fix ESLint and TypeScript errors.

**Copilot Response**: (1) Pinned Node.js 20.x in `package.json` and created `.nvmrc` to dodge `better-sqlite3` native compilation. (2) Migrated ESLint from legacy `.eslintrc.cjs` to modern flat config (`eslint.config.js`) with `typescript-eslint` type-aware rules. (3) Added `vscode-languageserver-textdocument` dependency. (4) Fixed 19 lint errors: corrected import groups, added UUID resilience, marked promises as `void` or awaited, narrowed `unknown` types, and removed unused bindings. Ran `npm run lint` successfully.

**Learnings**: Type-aware linting catches real issues (unsafe member access, floating promises) early; pinning portable Node LTS avoids CI/contributor toolchain friction.

---

## Turn 15: Copilot Instructions & Constitution Update (Lines 3300–3620)

**User Request**: Refresh `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `constitution.md` to capture "always true" workspace facts and development principles.

**Copilot Response**: Updated `copilot-instructions.md` to document: workspace shape (npm workspaces, supporting directories), primary tooling (VS Code Extension API, SQLite, vscode.lm), build commands. Added reminders: development is synchronous (you + Copilot only), chat history lives in `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/`, use terminal to navigate gitignored directories when needed. Refreshed `constitution.md` with principles: (1) documentation unity (keep docs ↔ code aligned), (2) leverage official tooling, (3) responsible AI (consent before cloud calls), (4) fast feedback, (5) simplicity/stewardship. Noted that no external contributors or asynchronous git activity are in scope for now.

**Learnings**: Always-in-context instructions remind Copilot of foundational assumptions; constitution keeps high-level values explicit across all implementation work.

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes

- **Ride Existing Wins**: Prefer `execute*Provider` APIs over parsers; consume language-server diagnostics; mirror VS Code's cache-invalidation model.
- **Consent & Transparency**: No cloud LLM calls until user picks provider; surface cost/model info prominently.
- **Reproducibility**: Graph is deterministic (accurate spans, confidence scores), benchmarks (AST + self-similarity) validate correctness.
- **Modular, Type-Safe Code**: Early infrastructure (queue, settings bridge, maintenance) unblocks feature work; lint enforcement catches bugs.

---

## Salient Decisions Ratified
1. **LSP backend** over extension—avoids context-window loss, enables reuse.
2. **Inference-first** links (no front matter)—aligns with VS Code workspace indexing.
3. **Explicit provider selection** gate—enforces responsible AI, respects user autonomy.
4. **Dual-mode accuracy** (AST + self-similarity)—enables verification against ground truth where possible.
5. **Node 20** LTS—prebuilt binaries, portable across dev/CI.

---

## Next Phase
Continue `/speckit.implement` with User Stories 1–3: link inference orchestrator (T026), markdown watcher (T029), diagnostic publishing (T027), acknowledgement service (T036), and integration tests (T030–T035).
