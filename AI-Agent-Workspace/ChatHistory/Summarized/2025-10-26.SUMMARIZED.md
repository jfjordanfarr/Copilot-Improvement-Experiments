---

## Turn 01: Day 10 Kickoff & Required Inputs (Lines 1–200)
- **User** opened Dev Day 10 by requesting a turn-by-turn recap of 2025-10-25, insisting on the 1k-line piton workflow.
- **Context**: Supplied the latest commit slate (`41167b1`, `3779a3a`, `b6dc52e`, `62a8d8b`, `4be2862`) and a fresh workspace tree to anchor the audit trail.

## Turn 02: Hydration & Readiness Check (Lines 201–360)
- **Copilot** reread every prior daily summary (10/16–10/25) plus the standing Copilot and MDMD instructions to rebuild context.
- **Response**: Confirmed readiness to begin the chunked summarization once granted the go-ahead.

## Turn 03: Summary Deliverable Restated (Lines 361–420)
- **User** noted that `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-25.SUMMARIZED.md` remained empty and reiterated the requirement for a commit-correlated, turn-by-turn recap.

## Turn 04: First Autosummarization Misstep (Lines 421–520)
- **Copilot** attempted to ingest large swaths of 2025-10-25.md in one pass, triggering lossy autosummarization and leaving the summary file untouched.

## Turn 05: Process Reinforcement (Lines 521–600)
- **User** re-emphasized the non-negotiable cadence: read 1,000 lines, write the summary chunk, then proceed—no search shortcuts.

## Turn 06: Second Autosummarization & Reminder (Lines 601–680)
- **Copilot** repeated the mistake by reloading the full conversation, again causing autosummarization without producing output.
- **User** pointed out the repeated slip and urged adherence to the proven piton workflow that succeeded on earlier dev days.

## Turn 07: Rehydration Reset (Lines 681–760)
- **Copilot** restarted hydration by rereading prior summaries and the 2025-10-25 log.
- **User** supplied the Day 10 cliffhanger: MDMD heading cleanup is the next priority, with explicit permission to adjust `mdmd.instructions.md` or `copilot-instructions.md` if conflicting guidance appears.

## Turn 08: Symbol Audit Reconnaissance (Lines 761–860)
- **Copilot** gathered diagnostics for the heading cleanup: captured `git status`, reviewed `slopcop.config.json`, ran `npm run slopcop:symbols -- --json`, and inspected relevant specs/MDMD docs along with the vendored GitHub slugger implementation (including a quick `npx tsx -e "slug(...)"` probe).
- **Intent**: Understand how current headings and link targets diverge before editing.

## Turn 09: Manual Anchor Proposal Withdrawn (Lines 861–1000)
- **Copilot** briefly prepared changes that would inject manual `<a id>` anchors into `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md` to satisfy missing slugs.
- **User** vetoed the approach, undoing the edits and insisting on solutions compatible with standard Markdown headings. They shared the inaugural `slopcop:symbols` report: 109 issues—seven missing anchors in MDMD/Specs and 102 duplicate-heading warnings in test fixtures—establishing the backlog for the coming cleanup.

---

## Turn 10: Symbol Audit Backlog Captured (Lines 1001–1120)
- **User** recorded the full `npm run slopcop:symbols -- --json` output (109 issues) into the chat log so the duplicate-heading fixtures and missing MDMD anchors would be preserved for the next work block.
- **Copilot** acknowledged the dump, agreeing to keep Markdown headings untouched while fixing callers, and deferred the cleanup to the following pass.

## Turn 11: Next-Step Alignment for Heading Cleanup (Lines 1121–1240)
- **User** asked for Copilot’s game plan and expectations of the PM; Copilot proposed scripting slug fixes, prioritising the seven MDMD/spec errors, and optionally muting noisy fixtures.
- **Guidance**: User authorised tasteful heading renames inside MDMD and blessed ignoring test fixtures if they’re intentionally repetitive, clearing the path for automated fixes.

## Turn 12: Slugger-Driven MDMD Repairs & Audit Green (Lines 1241–1500)
- **Copilot** rehydrated after an autosummarisation slip, reran the vendored slugger to compute canonical anchors, and patched MDMD/spec links plus `slopcop.config.json` to ignore fixture noise.
- `npm run slopcop:symbols -- --json` returned clean, `npm run graph:snapshot`/`npm run graph:audit` confirmed coverage, and the work mapped to commit `53e1b235` (“symbol audit ignores… + MDMD fixes”).

## Turn 13: Analyze with AI Command Lands (Lines 1501–2000)
- **Copilot** implemented the `analyzeWithAI` command, reusable `LlmInvoker`, contract updates (`packages/shared/src/contracts/llm.ts`), graph-store persistence, and language-server plumbing so LLM assessments can be stored and displayed in the diagnostics tree.
- Test/verify cycle: `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`, and follow-up graph/symbol audits all passed, leaving documentation updates outstanding before provider dogfooding.

## Turn 14: Layer-4 Docs & Coverage Audit (Lines 2001–2180)
- **Copilot** authored Layer-4 MDMD briefs for Analyze with AI, LlmInvoker, and shared LLM contracts, refreshed language-server docs, and aligned diagnostics documentation with the live workflow.
- `npm run graph:audit` reported zero undocumented artifacts, confirming the new command and services are reflected in permanent docs.

## Turn 15: Local Model Wiring Clarified (Lines 2181–2320)
- **User** challenged the claim of a first-party Ollama connector; **Copilot** corrected the guidance and prescribed using Microsoft’s AI Toolkit to register local models with `vscode.lm`.
- **Copilot** outlined the dogfooding path: connect Gemma via the Toolkit, keep `llmProviderMode` at `local-only`, run Analyze with AI to cache the model, then validate with the integration suite.

## Turn 16: Dogfooding Hit Electron ABI Wall (Lines 2321–2480)
- **User** connected Gemma3 27B and relaunched the extension, but activation failed because `better_sqlite3.node` only existed for Node ABI 127 while the host expected Electron ABI 136.
- **Copilot** triaged the crash, requested a forced native rebuild, and began cataloging the running Node and Electron versions after confirming the mismatch persisted.

## Turn 17: Electron-Native Rebuild Implemented (Lines 2481–2700)
- **Copilot** inspected the installed binaries, queried `node-abi`, and rewrote `scripts/rebuild-better-sqlite3.mjs` plus `GraphStore` so both Node and Electron bindings are produced and selected automatically.
- Regenerated the natives via `npm run rebuild:better-sqlite3:force`, rebuilt the shared package, and staged the fix that later landed as commit `00c621d`.

## Turn 18: textDocument/diagnostic Pull Support (Lines 2701–3000)
- **User** surfaced the lingering `textDocument/diagnostic` LSP error; **Copilot** traced the missing pull handler in the language server.
- Added a caching `DiagnosticPublisher`, registered the `DocumentDiagnosticRequest`, and routed change/orphan flows through the cache, with unit and integration suites still pending.

## Tests & Tooling (Chunks 1–2)
- `npm run slopcop:symbols -- --json` (multiple passes) to surface and validate heading fixes.
- `npx tsx -e "import { slug } from './packages/shared/src/tooling/githubSlugger.ts'; console.log(slug('User Story 2 - Writers get drift alerts (Priority: P2)'))";` to prove slug parity.
- `npm run graph:snapshot`, `npm run graph:audit`, `npm run slopcop:markdown`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:unit` to confirm the new command and docs stay within guardrails.

## Tests & Tooling (Chunk 3)
- `npm run graph:audit` after the doc refresh confirmed coverage stayed green.
- `npm run rebuild:better-sqlite3:force` and `npm run build -w packages/shared` validated the dual-ABI rebuild flow.
- Pending: rerun `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:integration` to exercise the diagnostic cache changes.

## Cross-Cutting Themes (Chunks 1–2)
- Persistent piton-saving of 1k-line chunks avoids losing intent when autosummarisation strikes.
- Treat MDMD headings as source of truth—fix callers with slug-aware tooling instead of injecting manual anchors.
- The new Analyze command extends diagnostics from detection to guided remediation, but still awaits final documentation and provider wiring in later chunks.

## Cross-Cutting Themes (Chunk 3)
- Documentation now mirrors the Analyze-with-AI pipeline end-to-end, reinforcing the MDMD ↔ code traceability loop.
- Native module management treats VS Code’s Electron runtime as a first-class build target to unblock local dogfooding.
- Diagnostics infrastructure is converging on parity between push and pull modes, eliminating protocol gaps revealed during testing.

## Turn 19: Verify Chain Fails on Electron ABI Gap (Lines 3001–3320)
- **Copilot** reran `npm run test:unit` after the scripted Node/Electron rebuild, yielding a full coverage report and confirming 35 suites passed under ABI 127/136 dual binaries.
- **Integration** `npm run test:integration` immediately failed: every US1–US5 suite aborted during extension activation because the Electron (ABI 136) `better-sqlite3` binding was missing, causing `npm run safe:commit` to halt in the verify step.
- **User** reran `npm run graph:snapshot`, `npm run graph:audit`, and the SlopCop audits to gauge overall health; coverage audit now reported only one file-level gap (`diagnosticPublisher.ts`).
- **Learning**: Electron-native bindings must be available before the VS Code harness can even initialize, keeping verify from progressing to integration assertions.

## Turn 20: Integration Harness Repaired & Tests Go Green (Lines 3321–3500)
- **Copilot** inspected `rebuild-better-sqlite3.mjs`, the integration runner, and `graphStore.js`, then patched `acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts` to open the database through the Electron ABI binding via `openReadonlyDatabase`.
- **Commands**: `npm run rebuild:better-sqlite3:force` followed by `npm run test:integration` now rebuilt both ABIs and produced a passing log (19 specs, 1 pending) with `isServerReady` telemetry, restoring the full end-to-end suite.
- **User** supplied the green integration transcript, clearing the native-binding blocker and capturing the remaining doc coverage warning for follow-up.
- **Learning**: Even integration tests that only read from SQLite must use the Electron ABI to avoid reintroducing runtimes mismatches.

## Turn 21: Diagnostic Publisher Documented & Specs Updated (Lines 3501–3600)
- **Copilot** acknowledged the graph audit gap, read MDMD instructions, and created `.mdmd/layer-4/server-diagnostics/diagnosticPublisher.mdmd.md` documenting collaborators and evidence links.
- **Spec Maintenance**: `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md` now marks US1–US4 as Delivered (2025-10-26) with pointers to the integration suites that verified them.
- **Result**: `npm run safe:commit` completed cleanly—graph snapshot, doc audit, and all SlopCop checks passed with no remaining warnings.
- **Learning**: File-level coverage stays trustworthy when new code artifacts trigger immediate MDMD updates and spec checkboxes.

## Turn 22: Escalating to Symbol-Level Coverage (Lines 3601–3914)
- **User** set the next milestone: every public symbol must appear in at least one MDMD doc, and diagnostic headings must avoid orphan references; requested renewed high-agency execution.
- **Copilot** rehydrated the entire Day 11 log (lines 1–3914), reopened `snapshot-workspace.ts`, and sketched a plan to extend graph snapshots with exported symbol metadata, then audit MDMD headings against those exports.
- **Expectation Reset**: User reiterated the lead-developer role, insisting on tangible tool usage and proactive progress; provided the full workspace tree to aid symbol harvesting strategy.
- **Learning**: With file-level gaps closed, focus shifts to per-symbol traceability, demanding compiler-integrated exports capture plus structured MDMD headings.

## Turn 23: Exported Symbol Metadata & Strict Audit (Lines 3915–4300)
- **Copilot** upgraded `workspaceIndexProvider.ts` to harvest exported symbol names and inline code references, enhanced `audit-doc-coverage.ts` with documented/undocumented export reporting and a `--strict-symbols` gate, and authored `diagnosticPublisher.mdmd.md` so the new audit registered at least one positive hit.
- **Verification**: Ran `npm run graph:snapshot`, `npm run graph:audit -- --workspace . --strict-symbols`, and `git status`, then committed `feat: audit exported symbol coverage` capturing the metadata pipeline plus the new documentation.
- **User** celebrated the tooling leap, confirmed the audit only targets `export`-qualified surfaces, and set the expectation to start documenting high-impact commands and services via explicit symbol call-outs.

## Turn 24: Extension Docs Gain Exported Symbol Sections (Lines 4301–5000)
- **Copilot** added `## Exported Symbols` listings across the extension Layer‑4 docs (commands, diagnostics, services, settings, views, watchers) and introduced `acknowledgeDiagnostic.mdmd.md` plus `extension-shared/artifactSchemas.mdmd.md` to cover previously undocumented exports.
- **Validation**: `npm run graph:snapshot` followed by `npx tsx ... audit-doc-coverage.ts --strict-symbols` lifted coverage to 130/411 (32%); `git status` snapshots recorded the doc sweep.
- **User** approved the direction, encouraged future bidirectional docstring ↔ MDMD syncing, and prompted a shift away from bullet-only symbol lists in favor of heading anchors for richer semantics.

## Turn 25: Server Diagnostics & Knowledge Docs Converted to Headings (Lines 5001–5650)
- **Copilot** refactored the fresh symbol sections into heading-style anchors, expanded docs for diagnostics controllers, knowledge ingestion modules, and created `rippleTypes.mdmd.md`, pushing symbol coverage to 146/411 (36%).
- **Workflow**: Each batch triggered `npm run graph:snapshot` and `npm run graph:audit`, with diffs showing concentrated updates in `.mdmd/layer-4` alongside regenerated `workspace.snapshot.json`.
- **User** reiterated the high-agency mandate, reinforcing the heading-based approach to keep future docstring synchronization viable.

## Turn 26: Symbol Ignore List & Audit Filtering (Lines 5651–6200)
- **Copilot** introduced `symbol-coverage.ignore.json` (initially excluding `tests/**`) and taught `audit-doc-coverage.ts` to honor the ignore patterns while preserving file-level coverage checks.
- **Command Log**: `npm run graph:audit -- --json` confirmed the filter worked, reporting 192/394 documented exports (49%) with noisy test fixtures removed from the deficit list.
- **User** endorsed the high-agency progress and supplied the latest snapshot/audit output to keep the plan grounded.

## Turn 27: Dependencies, Watchers, and Runtime Docs Filled In (Lines 6201–6800)
- **Copilot** documented server dependency analyzers, symbol bridge providers, watcher pipelines, and runtime change-processing flows, creating new MDMD files (e.g., `symbolBridgeProvider.mdmd.md`, `workspaceIndexProvider.mdmd.md`, `changeProcessor.mdmd.md`).
- **Evidence**: Successive `npm run graph:snapshot` and `npm run graph:audit` runs bumped symbol coverage to 238/394 (60%), narrowing remaining gaps to runtime helpers and shared contracts.
- **User** acknowledged the milestone and greenlit a full push to 100% coverage.

## Turn 28: Shared Contracts & Tooling Complete Symbol Coverage (Lines 6801–7400)
- **Copilot** authored Layer‑4 docs for runtime environment/settings, telemetry, shared contracts (dependencies, diagnostics, LSIF/SCIP, maintenance, overrides, symbols), inference utilities, and tooling helpers, ensuring every export had a dedicated heading.
- **Result**: `npm run graph:snapshot` + `npm run graph:audit` reported 394/394 documented exports with zero gaps, confirming strict symbol coverage is satisfied.
- **Next Step**: Suggested running `npm run safe:commit` to verify the full pipeline before landing the changes.

## Turn 29: SlopCop Broken Links Resolved (Lines 7401–7900)
- **Copilot** executed `npm run safe:commit`, which surfaced SlopCop markdown link failures stemming from newly added Layer‑4 docs referencing missing Layer‑3 anchors or stale script paths.
- **Fix**: Updated parent `knowledge-graph-ingestion` and `slopcop` references, replaced nonexistent evidence paths with real test suites and CLI docs, then reran `npm run slopcop:markdown` to confirm zero broken links.
- **State**: Safe-to-commit rerun showed lint, unit, integration, graph audits, and SlopCop all green with symbol coverage still at 100%.

## Turn 30: Final Safe-to-Commit & Cross-Link Commit (Lines 7901–8376)
- **Copilot** reran `npm run safe:commit` end-to-end—eslint, dual ABI rebuilds, Vitest (35 suites), VS Code integration harness (19 passing, 1 pending), graph snapshot/audit, and every SlopCop check—yielding a fully clean workspace and 100% symbol documentation.
- **User** confirmed history files are part of the tracked artifacts and invited Copilot to commit; Copilot proposed `docs: repair layer-4 mdmd cross-links for slopcop`, which landed shortly after as commit `be0a9486`.
- **Outcome**: Day closes with file, symbol, and doc coverage all enforced by automation, setting the stage for tomorrow’s follow-up.
