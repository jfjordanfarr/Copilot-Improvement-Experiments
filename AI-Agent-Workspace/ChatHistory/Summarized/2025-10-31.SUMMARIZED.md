## Turn 01: Quote-Enriched Summary Mandate (Lines 1–60)
- **User**: “Please enhance the 10/30 summary with actual quotes from both of us… [and] add the… commit to be correlated.”
- **Copilot**: Re-read the dev-history prompt plus every prior daily summary to rehydrate context before editing.
- **Focus**: Confirm instructions + commit (`6473d51…`) before modifying `2025-10-30.SUMMARIZED.md`.

## Turn 02: Embedding Quotes, Tracking Progress (Lines 61–260)
- **Copilot**: Began annotating Turn 1–8 of the 10/30 summary with verbatim dialogue, noting in-chat “Doc Update – Embedded the verbatim lead quotes for Turns 01–08…”
- **User**: Encouraged the cadence with “Continue annotating turns in the same way.”
- **Result**: Summary now captures pivotal user/Copilot wording for early Oct 30 turns.

## Turn 03: Continuing Annotation Through Autosummarization (Lines 261–520)
- **Copilot**: Pressed on through Turns 9–12, describing updates like “Added direct user/copilot quotes for turns 09–12.”
- **User**: Reiterated the expectation—“Continue with the next batch… Use your best judgment.”
- **Outcome**: Process reinforced despite lossy autosummarization events.

## Turn 04: Rehydration & Alignment on Quote Scope (Lines 521–760)
- **Copilot**: After an autosummarization drop, restated status (“Oct 30 summary already has quotes through Turn 29…”) and awaited direction.
- **User**: Clarified, “Not every conversation turn may require a quote… The point… is to help preserve the salient plot points.”
- **Agreement**: Continue quoting where meaningful, skip pure log dumps.

## Turn 05: Finalizing 10/30 Summary Coverage (Lines 761–1180)
- **Copilot**: Read the remaining Oct 30 transcript (“lines 7441 to 8286”) and appended the closing turns, reporting “Added the remaining turns to 2025-10-30.SUMMARIZED.md.”
- **User**: Confirmed completion; requested next-step planning against MDMD and spec docs.
- **State**: Oct 30 summary now fully quoted and commit-ready, enabling shift toward planning.

## Turn 06: Terminal Follow-Through & Report Inspection (Lines 1181–1480)
- **User**: Praised the caution around rerunning commands—“You are very perceptive!… The results of that terminal command… look quite promising!”—and warned that VS Code often marks tool calls complete before output finishes.
- **Copilot**: Reviewed `docs/test-report.md`, noting “metadata stamps (commit `6473d51…`, branch `main`) look intact” and that both AST accuracy and rebuild stability results were captured.
- **Outcome**: Verified the new report while reaffirming the need to watch for prematurely “completed” terminal tasks.

## Turn 07: Broadening Benchmark Census (Lines 1481–1820)
- **User**: Wanted a larger sample—“We should get at least one other language in there… I feel like… we should try to get a broader census of how our system actually performs.”
- **Copilot**: Agreed and outlined options for additional fixtures, cautioning that integration suites should stay separate from benchmarks to avoid coupling.
- **Decision**: Expand the manifest-driven fixture set before tuning thresholds.

## Turn 08: New Language Fixtures & Documentation Sweep (Lines 1821–2200)
- **User**: Celebrated the plan—“THIS… Please begin scaffolding additional fixtures…”—and reiterated the need to document and audit everything.
- **Copilot**: Added Python and Rust benchmark fixtures (plus richer TypeScript samples), updated `fixtures.manifest.json`, ran `fixtures:verify`, regenerated the AST report, and created Layer‑4 docs (`astAccuracyFixtures.mdmd.md`, `verifyScript.mdmd.md`, etc.).
- **Result**: `npm run graph:audit` returned clean; the refreshed test report now lists four languages.

## Turn 09: Full Verify Run & Commit Prep (Lines 2201–2400)
- **User**: Shared the successful `verify.mjs --mode ast --report` output and said, “Looks excellent. Please prep a commit… .”
- **Copilot**: Staged changes, summarised the work (“Added Python and Rust benchmark fixtures… regenerated test-report.md”), and confirmed tests (`fixtures:verify`, `verify.mjs`, graph snapshot/audit`) prior to handoff.
- **State**: Benchmarks expanded, reports updated, and workspace staged awaiting the final commit.

## Commit Correlation
- **6473d51c4c577892c7d5a281128881e342d36e52** — `feat: add relationship rule engine and document symbol correctness`; reflected in Turns 06–09 as the AST benchmark expansion, reporting updates, and commit preparation that closed the day’s work.
