---

## Turn 01: Dev Day 11 Kickoff & Requirements (Lines 1-220)
- **User** reset the context for Dev Day 11, requesting a fresh turn-by-turn recap of 2025-10-26 with explicit git correlations (`53e1b235`, `00c621d`, `b5042e0`, `be0a9486`).
- Workspace inventory, SpecKit structure, and MDMD lattice were shared to anchor the summarization run; instructions reiterated the 1,000-line chunking discipline and prior-summary hydration ritual.
- **Copilot** began staging the task by inspecting the provided tree and commit list, preparing to ingest the raw log.

## Turn 02: Autosummarization Tripwire #1 (Lines 221-605)
- **Copilot** attempted to read the entire 2025-10-26 transcript in one go, triggering lossy autosummarization before any summary chunks were written.
- **User** highlighted the recurring mistake, reminding Copilot to rely on prior summaries plus intermediate pitons in the new recap file so autosummarization cannot derail progress.
- Lesson reinforced: sustained compliance requires saving every 1k-line batch before advancing.

## Turn 03: Autosummarization Tripwire #2 (Lines 606-695)
- A second whole-file read caused another autosummarization window.
- **User** ("Bro. ... facepalm") insisted on rehydrating with every prior dev-day summary again, then restarting the 2025-10-26 review from line 1 with disciplined checkpoints.
- **Copilot** acknowledged the reset mandate.

## Turn 04: Process Reset & Proper Hydration (Lines 696-1090)
- **Copilot** reread all daily summaries from 2025-10-16 through 2025-10-26, satisfying the prerequisite hydration step before touching the raw log again.
- **User** confirmed compliance ("Nicely done!") and re-authorized the chunked summarization workflow.
- The first 1,000 lines of the 2025-10-26 transcript were ingested and summarized into `2025-10-26.SUMMARIZED.md`, establishing the first piton.

## Turn 05: High-Agency Mandate (Lines 1091-1200)
- After Copilot checked in between chunks, **User** reiterated the pricing model (per prompt) and demanded higher-agency execution: complete the entire recap before returning, only reporting once the summary is fully correlated with the supplied commits.
- The expectation moving forward is fewer behavioral interruptions—consume, summarize, persist, and only surface once the full Day 10 recap is complete.

## Turn 06: Enforcing Heading-Based Symbol Declarations (Lines 1201-1425)
- **User** rejected the residual bullet-list pattern inside Layer‑4 MDMD docs, clarifying that exported symbols must live in heading titles only.
- **Copilot** converted 16 affected docs to `#### SymbolName` sections, removing list markup and restating descriptions under each heading; reran `npm run graph:audit`, observing that the orphan report persisted because inline backticked literals were still treated as symbols.
- Next step agreed: filter extractor output rather than reverting to list formatting.

## Turn 07: Tightening the Symbol Extractor (Lines 1426-1645)
- **User** chose the extractor-path fix—`extractExportedSymbolsSection` should only capture identifier-shaped tokens.
- **Copilot** updated the audit script to ignore literals and non-symbol inline code, then reran `npm run graph:audit` (after `graph:snapshot`). Coverage dipped to 95%, exposing the true delta: 21 extension exports lacked documentation references, while ~35 MDMD headings still cited option flags or external types.
- The refined report highlighted concrete mismatches (e.g., `registerAnalyzeWithAICommand`, `LlmProviderMode`, `ParsedEdge`), shifting the focus to documentation hygiene.

## Turn 08: Remediating Extension & Ingestion Docs (Lines 1646-1910)
- **User** directed a three-step cleanup: cite every extension export in its Layer‑4 doc, prune non-export literals from ingestion docs, and revalidate via snapshot + audit.
- **Copilot** began revising extension docs (`acknowledgeDiagnostic.mdmd.md`, `analyzeWithAI.mdmd.md`, quick pick + tree view entries) so each section explicitly references its symbol, and trimmed option-string callouts from knowledge-ingestion docs.
- Follow-up audit runs confirmed structural fixes but continued to flag the remaining ingestion symbols, prompting deeper rewrites.

## Turn 09: Deep Symbol Alignment Pass (Lines 1911-2400)
- Extensive doc edits continued across dependencies, ingestion, runtime, and telemetry Layer‑4 files to reference actual exports (functions, classes, types) instead of options or string literals.
- `npm run graph:snapshot` + `npm run graph:audit` now report 100% documented export coverage, yet a smaller orphan list persists where docs still mention helper constructs (`onStatusChanged`, `GraphStore`, `INVOKE_LLM_REQUEST`, etc.).
- **User** reiterated the mandate to finish the alignment entirely; Copilot proceeded to iterate on the remaining headings, keeping markdown/asset lint clean (`npm run slopcop:markdown`).

## Turn 10: Final Symbol Cleanup & Audit Success (Lines 2401-2740)
 - Copilot pruned the remaining non-export literals across knowledge ingestion, runtime, telemetry, shared, and tooling docs and reworded descriptions so only real exports remain in the heading sections.
 - `npm run graph:audit` confirmed the sanitized structure, setting the stage for full-coverage validation.
 - Recommendation issued to run `npm run safe:commit` before committing given the large doc sweep.

## Turn 11: Comprehensive Safe-to-Commit Run (Lines 2741-3160)
 - **User** executed `npm run safe:commit`, which chained lint, forced dual-ABI `better-sqlite3` rebuilds, unit tests (35 files, 132 tests), integration suites (19 passing, 1 pending by design), `graph:snapshot`, `graph:audit`, and all SlopCop checks.
 - The audit surfaced four lingering export gaps (Disposable, KnowledgeGraphBridgeDisposable, LSIFParser, parseLSIF) despite overall 99% coverage, and the working tree captured every touched Layer‑4 doc plus updated snapshot + audit script.
 - **User** requested a commit once the symbol gaps were resolved.

## Turn 12: Closing Residual Export Gaps & Committing (Lines 3161-3375)
 - Copilot investigated the remaining flagged exports, added explicit inline references in the appropriate docs (knowledge feed manager, bridge, LSIF parser), refreshed the snapshot, and reran `npm run graph:audit` to reach 394/394 coverage.
 - With the workspace clean and validations already green, Copilot staged everything—including updated chat logs—and committed as `docs: align layer-4 exports with symbol audit`.

## Turn 13: Rebuilding the User Intent Census & MDMD Signal Extraction (Lines 3376-3600)
- **User** tasked Copilot with refreshing `user-intent-census.md` using verbatim quotes sourced from raw logs (not summaries) and capturing every requirements-oriented prompt.
- Initial attempt overemphasized summarization behaviors; user requested direct quotations and less terminal noise, prompting a rehydration strategy that processes one dev day at a time.
- A broader vision emerged: extract per-layer MDMD signals for each dev day. Copilot created `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/MDMD-Signals/layer-{1..4}` and generated the first day’s files (`2025-10-16.layer{1..4}.md`), then repeated the workflow for 2025-10-17—each document quoting salient instructions with line ranges.

## Turn 14: Finishing 10/16 & Building 10/19 Signal Docs (Lines 3601-4010)
- After another rehydration piton, **User** insisted Copilot finish 10/16’s final chunk and mine all of 10/19 before checking in; Copilot reread the late-day directives and updated the Layer‑3/Layer‑4 docs accordingly.
- Full 10/19 extraction produced four new Layer signal files capturing mandates like “for any given change…” automation guarantees, dogfooding requirements, and speckit-driven planning orders.
- When the user pointed out missing lines 2399‑3395, Copilot reread that tail section and patched each layer file with the clarification on MDMD stewardship, better-sqlite3 rebuild documentation, dependency graph ordering, and end-of-day commit guidance.

## Turn 15: 10/20 Signal Extraction & Process Discipline (Lines 4011-4365)
- Charged to process entire days without interim check-ins, Copilot ingested 10/20 in staged 1k-line sweeps, continually rehydrating the MDMD layer files between autosummarization events.
- New documents `2025-10-20.layer{1..4}.md` memorialize Option A momentum, auditability demands, runtime decomposition, knowledge-feed seeding, ripple analyzer refactors, and analyzer/test expansions.
- **User** validated the 10/20 set (“Well done!”) and reiterated the piton workflow before directing Copilot toward the expansive 10/21 transcript.

## Turn 16: Wrestling 10/21’s Autosummarizations (Lines 4366-4800)
- Copilot repeatedly reread 10/21’s log in 400-line windows, creating the day’s four layer docs while dealing with lossy context resets; the user enforced strict rehydration on every autosummarization, even making Copilot restate the step-by-step plan aloud for future reuse.
- Additional passes filled gaps in the 2400‑3200 stretch, captured diagnostics tree rollout instructions, Node 22 mandate, rebuild tooling, and final commit orders—ensuring each layer file gained explicit quotes with line numbers.
- With every correction applied, the user cleared Copilot to advance to 10/22 once the 10/21 files reflected the missing late-day directives.

## Turn 17: Completing 10/22 Signal Mining (Lines 4801-5200)
- Copilot drifted past line 4000, prompting the user to rewind to the 4k piton and reapply the mdmd.extract signal rules; repeated rehydrations emphasized one-thousand-line increments and strict prompt compliance.
- Fresh passes captured the 4000‑4999 and 5000‑5152 ranges, updating the 10/22 Layer‑2/3/4 docs with rebuild-on-verify mandates, CLI startup sequencing, Electron-version detection, and README/quickstart refreshes.
- The user confirmed the entire 5,152-line transcript was now represented and immediately queued the 10/23 extraction.

## Turn 18: Taming 10/23’s Oversized Transcript (Lines 5201-5600)
- Initial attempts gulped the whole 6,577-line log, so the user reset the workflow: reread the mdmd prompt, hydrate per layer, and process in 1.2k-line slices while patching after every chunk.
- Iterative sweeps populated `2025-10-23.layer{1..3}.md` with directives covering symbol neighbor quick-pick automation, drift-history persistence fixes, and documentation expectations, while Layer‑4 updates were deferred after an accidental doc edit was reverted.
- By the end of the pass Copilot logged the quick-pick harness stubbing, timeout research mandate, and integration green-path instructions, satisfying the user’s chunked extraction requirement.

## Turn 19: 10/24 Signals & Aggregate Census Kickoff (Lines 5601-6000)
- Copilot began the 10/24 mining run, spinning up fresh Layer‑1/2/3 files that record the Dev Day summary mandate, T067 CLI work, audit output parity, and LLM-aligned instrumentation expectations.
- After another autosummarization stumble, the user revealed the remaining layer docs had been generated elsewhere and redirected Copilot to craft new aggregate census documents for Layers 1–3 using `###` anchors for future deep links.
- Copilot authored initial aggregate summaries, then—after being told to read every dated signal—expanded Layer 1’s census across 10/16–10/26 and prepared to repeat the sweep for Layers 2 and 3.

## Turn 20: Aligning Aggregates With Canonical MDMD Docs (Lines 6001-6400)
- User asked whether aggregate layer summaries should fold back into the `.mdmd` documentation lattice or spawn lint rules; Copilot compared Layer‑1/Layer‑2 aggregates against `link-aware-diagnostics-vision.mdmd.md` and `product-roadmap.mdmd.md`, highlighting overlaps and gaps.
- The duo debated traceability depth—mapping T04x milestones, reciprocal links, and “Active Decisions” lists—ultimately agreeing to keep aggregates as exploratory dashboards until the reconciliation process hardens.
- Copilot recommended leaving the MDMD docs untouched for now, deferring commits until the census work drives a concrete lint or documentation deliverable.
- When the user asked for next development moves, Copilot surfaced three options (docs pass, observability, graph benchmarks) and together they prioritized building fixture-driven graph/SlopCop verification.

## Turn 21: Fixture Verifier & C# Stress Workspace (Lines 6401-6800)
- Copilot implemented `scripts/fixture-tools/verify-fixtures.ts`, `fixtures.manifest.json`, and `npm run fixtures:verify`, enabling graph snapshot/audit plus SlopCop passes against each fixture; the initial run failed because `simple-workspace` lacked docs and `slopcop-assets` intentionally referenced missing files.
- A new `csharp-advanced-symbols` fixture (complete with nested namespaces, abstract classes, and extension methods) was added to probe export detection; temporary graph audit opt-out was recorded in the manifest until C# coverage matures.
- User requested healing `simple-workspace` instead of loosening linting; Copilot added `docs/implementation-map.md`, rewrote `architecture.md` via LLM tools to eliminate hundreds of duplicated headings, and reran `fixtures:verify`, clearing that workspace while leaving the asset fixture failure intact.
- Discussion clarified that asset missing targets were by design; consensus reached to convert negative cases into temporary mutations so baseline fixtures can remain green.

## Turn 22: Healing Fixtures, Documenting Harnesses & Tests (Lines 6801-7200)
- Copilot populated the asset workspace with actual files (images, fonts, videos, hashed assets), created fixture docs (`docs/tooling/fixture-verifier.md`, `fixture-catalog.md`), and authored new Vitest suites `tests/integration/slopcop/assetsAudit.test.ts` and `symbolsAudit.test.ts` to mutate healed fixtures in temp copies and assert diagnostics.
- Manifest entries and fixture docs gained index/symbol maps; repeated `npm run fixtures:verify`, `graph:snapshot`, `graph:audit`, and `npm run test:unit` confirmed the updated harness works, though `csharp-advanced-symbols` still skips graph audit pending support.
- User then instructed Copilot to wire `fixtures:verify` into `npm run safe:commit`, enable graph audit for the C# fixture, and drive the pipeline fully green—work left to complete in the next chunk.

## Turn 23: Final Hardening, Safe Commit, and Commit Prep (Lines 7201-7666)
- Copilot enabled graph audit for the C# fixture, updated workspace indexing rules, and iterated on `fixtures:verify` until the manifest, snapshot, and SlopCop passes all cleared alongside the full `npm run safe:commit` chain.
- Additional docs (`template-runner.md`, expanded implementation maps, C# fixture indexes) and `.gitignore` rules landed while transient tmp folders were cleaned from the tree; the user ensured AI-Agent scratch paths stay untracked.
- With the pipeline green, Copilot staged the curated set of changes—excluding MDMD signal files per instruction—and drafted the commit message **“Integrate fixtures verifier and expand fixture coverage,”** ready for final approval.

## Commit Correlations
