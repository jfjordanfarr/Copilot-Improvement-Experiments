## Commit Crosswalk
- `04f9af675f7037a0b9e71c838607d245c41edd22` → Turns 10–14: manifest-driven fixture verification, quickstart scoping, README consent updates.
- `bd3759ae8d90572da8cee9e661ccce2728b5be6f` → Turns 18–24: diagnostic latency telemetry, perf validation, associated docs/tests.
- `f3bee74c7ae65adadbbdf79bec356cd3b5348525` → Turns 26–35: benchmark telemetry design, shared tracker migration, SlopCop anchor cleanup, final safe-commit pass.

## Turn 01: Dev Day 12 Kickoff & Summary Mandate (Lines 1-78)
- **User** restated the dev-history regimen, instructing “Follow instructions in devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md… for 10/27/2025” and supplied the commits (`04f9af67`, `f0f951a8`) plus the empty summary file to populate.
- **Copilot** hydrated on the prompt and prior day summaries to prepare the turn-by-turn recap workflow.
- **Learning**: Daily recaps remain auditable artifacts tied to explicit commit hashes.

## Turn 02: Autosummarization Slip & Aggregate Noise (Lines 79-180)
- **Copilot** began reading the raw log but drifted into editing aggregate MDMD links before writing any summary pitons; autosummarization cut context mid-run.
- **User** flagged the misstep (“Ope almost there. You lost the plot in autosummarization…”) and demanded a reset to the 1,200-line piton routine.
- **Learning**: Summaries must land incrementally; unrelated doc edits during ingestion risk losing the trail.

## Turn 03: Commit Correlation Backfill (Lines 181-240)
- **User** reminded, “Please ensure commits are correlated in summary file before we move to next step.”
- **Copilot** reread the day’s summaries and appended the commit mapping (f0f951a8 ↔ Turns 06–12, 04f9af67 ↔ Turns 21–23) into `2025-10-27.SUMMARIZED.md`.
- **Learning**: Commit crosswalks are a non-negotiable part of daily retrospectives.

## Turn 04: MDMD Signal Extraction Kickoff (Lines 241-360)
- **User** pivoted to “Follow instructions in mdmd.extract.signals.prompt.md… from 10/27.”
- **Copilot** reread layer templates and generated `2025-10-27.layer{1..4}.md`, capturing early-day directives around census extraction, per-layer structure, and export coverage fixes.
- **Learning**: Layered MDMD signal files remain the canonical way to memorialize per-day intent.

## Turn 05: Rehydration Discipline Reinforced (Lines 361-508)
- **User** noted progress stalled near line 3500 and insisted on continuing “in 1200 line increments to preserve progress.”
- **Copilot** reread the prompt, instructions, and signal files, then resumed chunked ingestion—though repeated reminders (“You lost the plot just a bit there… read this—mandatory”) were needed to stay aligned.
- **Learning**: Strict piton cadence plus rehydration after autosummarization is critical for accurate signal capture.

## Turn 06: Final 10/27 Signals & Aggregate Reflection (Lines 509-620)
- **User** supplied the decisive tail (`#file:2025-10-27.md:6074-7666`) to ensure late-day directives were recorded and asked for aggregate updates with a sanity check on their usefulness.
- **Copilot** patched each layer file with fixture-verifier mandates, safe-commit expectations, and exploratory-doc guidance, then echoed the highlights into the aggregate files while noting the aggregates felt “dense” and might benefit from merging overlapping bullets.
- **Learning**: Aggregate MDMD docs are helpful but risk overfiltering; periodic pruning keeps them actionable.

## Turn 07: Call for Narrative & Verification Rationale (Lines 621-780)
- **User** requested, “Read every single dev day SUMMARY file” and recap the overall story before tackling the day’s challenge about unifying repo and fixture verification.
- **Copilot** initially produced a terse response without rehydrating all summaries, prompting a “@agent Try Again” reset and a mandatory reread of `#file:2025-10-28.md:1-683`.
- **Learning**: Autosummarization drains context; compliance requires explicit rehydration before delivering strategic synthesis.

## Turn 08: Development Story & Dual-Command Justification (Lines 781-999)
- **Copilot** reread the entire 10/16–10/27 summary set, then narrated the project arc (SpecKit foundations → ripple diagnostics → SlopCop expansion → symbol coverage) and defended the split between `npm run verify` and `npm run fixtures:verify`, citing fixture realism and existing orchestration via `safe:commit`; suggested consolidating commands behind a single orchestrator while keeping behaviors isolated.
- **User** pressed for architecture-focused reasoning, emphasizing the goal is to hold fixtures to the same correctness standard without losing their non-MDMD shape.
- **Learning**: Verification design must balance realism in fixtures with maintainable automation; manifest-driven orchestration is a plausible refinements path.

## Turn 09: Safe-to-Commit Telemetry Shared (Lines 1000-1200)
- **User** pasted the full `npm run safe:commit` transcript, showing verify → graph snapshot/audit → fixtures verifier → SlopCop (markdown/assets/symbols) and a clean git status aside from the in-flight summary files.
- **Copilot** has yet to respond within this chunk, leaving the orchestration simplification discussion queued for the next segment.
- **Learning**: The current pipeline already chains repo and fixture checks sequentially; any redesign must preserve this comprehensive coverage while simplifying operator experience.

## Turn 10: Workspace QC Suggestions (Lines 1201-1290)
- **User** clarified they sought simplifications, not just confirmation that `fixtures:verify` already runs inside safe-to-commit.
- **Copilot** produced QC notes: reduce redundant native rebuilds, drive fixture verification via manifest-declared slopcop suites, address 0% CLI coverage, consolidate repeated operational guidance, and consider caching SlopCop scans across fixtures.
- **Learning**: MDMD-driven auditing can reveal both tooling redundancies and documentation debt that merit future cleanup.

## Turn 11: Manifest-Driven Fixtures & Coverage Hygiene (Lines 1291-1410)
- **User** endorsed the manifest idea and requested coverage investigation.
- **Copilot** added per-fixture `slopcopSuites` controls in `fixtures.manifest.json` with matching logic in `verify-fixtures.ts`, refreshed maintainer docs, excluded CLI entrypoints from coverage via `vitest.config.ts`, and documented the rationale (`vitestConfig.mdmd.md`).
- **Learning**: Declarative manifests keep fixtures realistic while trimming redundant lint runs and aligning coverage reports with intent.

## Turn 12: Safe-to-Commit Confirmation (Lines 1411-1445)
- **User** asked whether `safe-to-commit.mjs` required edits.
- **Copilot** verified the script already calls `fixtures:verify`, so no changes were necessary; manifest tweaks flow through automatically.
- **Learning**: Central orchestration points stay simple when downstream scripts absorb new configuration.

## Turn 13: Graph Audit Gap & Next Options (Lines 1446-1560)
- **User** reran `npm run safe:commit`; lint/unit/integration passed but graph audit flagged the new `vitestConfig.mdmd.md` as orphaned.
- **Copilot** linked the doc back to tooling parents, reran `npm run graph:audit` to green, and proposed next efforts: T047 (Analyze with AI command), T048 (quickstart refresh), T049 (ci-check entry point).
- **Learning**: Every new Layer‑4 doc must rejoin the knowledge graph immediately to keep audits stable.

## Turn 14: Task Reality Check & Quickstart Scope (Lines 1561-1720)
- **User** pointed out T047 was already implemented, asked for the quickstart revamp (T048), and queried why `ci-check` shouldn’t just reuse safe-to-commit.
- **Copilot** updated `quickstart.md` with rebind workflow guidance, confirmed T047’s implementation (not yet marked), and explained `ci-check` can wrap safe-to-commit minus git status for CI reuse.
- **Learning**: Documentation tasks should track lived behaviour; scripts should wrap, not duplicate, existing pipelines.

## Turn 15: Task Ledger Updates & New Priorities (Lines 1721-1800)
- **User** requested T047 be marked complete and another top-three list.
- **Copilot** ticked T047 in `tasks.md` and suggested focusing on T048/T049/T050 to align onboarding and contributor docs with recent tooling changes.
- **Learning**: Keeping SpecKit tasks in sync prevents duplicated effort on already-delivered features.

## Turn 16: Quickstart Scoping Guidance (Lines 1801-1880)
- **User** approved T048 with emphasis on folder-level tuning for diagnostics.
- **Copilot** added a “Scoping diagnostics by folder” section to `quickstart.md`, covering workspace settings, excludes, and targeted onboarding steps.
- **Learning**: Onboarding docs now teach teams how to dial the extension where it matters most.

## Turn 17: CI Entry & README Consent Refresh (Lines 1881-1960)
- **User** asked whether T049 was already satisfied and green-lit T050 (README consent + configuration guidance).
- **Copilot** confirmed `ci-check` already wraps `safe-to-commit --skip-git-status`, marked T049 complete, and expanded `README.md` with consent guardrails, folder scoping tips, and feed guidance.
- **Learning**: Contributor-facing docs now mirror the consent model and configuration ergonomics shipped in the extension.

## Turn 18: Next Priorities Alignment (Lines 1961-2040)
- **User** requested another top-three list.
- **Copilot** suggested T074 (SlopCop markdown CLI), T052 (latency telemetry), and T053 (latency perf test); user clarified the markdown audit already exists, endorsing the telemetry work.
- **Learning**: Focus shifts to observability—tracking diagnostic latency to validate performance.

## Turn 19: Latency Tracker Implementation (Lines 2041-2200)
- **Copilot** introduced `latencyTracker.ts`, shared telemetry contracts, instrumented `changeProcessor`, `changeQueue`, and diagnostic publishers, and added unit coverage before running shared/server builds.
- **User** flagged a lossy autosummarization and made Copilot rehydrate on lines 1214‑1754 to regain context.
- **Learning**: Telemetry plumbing now records queue-to-publish latency while maintaining the existing diagnostic flow.

## Turn 20: Continued Instrumentation & Unit Coverage (Lines 2201-2320)
- **Copilot** resumed after rehydration, wiring enqueue hooks, completion tracking, and crafting `latencyTracker.test.ts`; summarised the changes and proposed next steps (extension wiring or perf test).
- **User** requested both follow-ups despite repeated autosummarization slips, prompting another rehydration over lines 747‑2207 and cleanup of a corrupted `latencySummary.ts` edit.
- **Learning**: Large refactors demand disciplined rehydration to avoid losing track of recent edits.

## Turn 21: Latency Command & Perf Test (Lines 2321-2385)
- **Copilot** built the extension command `latencySummary.ts`, registered it in `package.json`, and authored `tests/integration/perf/diagnosticLatency.test.ts` to assert p95 latency stays within thresholds.
- **User** executed `npm run safe:commit`, confirming the expanded suite (20 passing, 1 pending) while prompting MDMD updates for the new surfaces.
- **Learning**: Latency telemetry now has both UI surfacing and integration coverage, closing T052/T053 behaviour.

## Turn 22: MDMD Coverage for Telemetry & Outstanding Symbols (Lines 2386-2401)
- **Copilot** added Layer‑4 docs for latency tracker, extension command, shared contracts, and the perf suite, reran `npm run graph:audit`, and reported success.
- **User** shared the latest safe-commit transcript showing full graph coverage but 99 % symbol coverage—missing references to the new latency command exports.
- **Learning**: Symbol-level documentation must catch up with new latency features to restore 100 % coverage in the next chunk.

## Turn 23: SlopCop & Symbol Coverage Remediation (Lines 2402-2695)
- **User** highlighted safe-commit output where symbol coverage flagged the new latency exports and SlopCop complained about missing task anchors.
- **Copilot** fixed the latency MDMD docs (correct spec slugs, removed inline-code command IDs), reran `npm run slopcop:symbols` and `npm run graph:audit`, and restored both audits to green.
- **Learning**: Inline code in docs is interpreted as a symbol reference—use prose when citing command IDs to keep lint rules accurate.

## Turn 24: Safe-to-Commit Pass & Task Updates (Lines 2696-2860)
- **User** reran `npm run safe:commit`; the entire chain passed, and the working tree contained telemetry code, docs, and chat history updates.
- **Copilot** summarized the deliverables, suggested the commit title “Instrument diagnostic latency telemetry and add perf validation,” and marked T052/T053 complete in `tasks.md`.
- **Learning**: Pair clean validation runs with task ledger updates before proposing commits.

## Turn 25: Task Ledger Hygiene (Lines 2861-2995)
- **User** asked about lingering open tasks (T048, T073, T074) and probed the benchmarking backlog.
- **Copilot** confirmed the quickstart refresh and SlopCop documentation were already done, checked off the tasks, and clarified that benchmarking items (T051, T057–T062) remain outstanding.
- **Learning**: Keeping SpecKit synchronized prevents redundant work and spotlights true priorities.

## Turn 26: Benchmark & Reporting Strategy (Lines 2996-3110)
- **User** requested bundling T051 with T057–T058 into a cohesive roadmap.
- **Copilot** authored the Layer‑3 `benchmark-telemetry-pipeline.mdmd.md`, outlining goals (test-report CLI, benchmark harnesses, inference metrics), scope boundaries, interfaces, and phased Code Like Clay next steps.
- **Learning**: A design-first pass aligns cross-cutting tasks before implementation begins.

## Turn 27: Scope Refinement & Task Bundle (Lines 3111-3185)
- **User** expanded the bundle to T051, T057, T058, T061, and T062 while parking T060 for later.
- **Copilot** updated the Layer‑3 plan to reflect the revised scope—covering dual-mode benchmarks, reporting, and telemetry—so docs and tasks stay in lockstep.
- **Learning**: Document scope pivots immediately to avoid drifting implementations.

## Turn 28: Layer-4 Benchmark Blueprint (Lines 3186-3201)
- **User** authorized high-agency progress on Layer‑4 design.
- **Copilot** produced Layer‑4 docs for the benchmark suites, inference accuracy tracker, and report generator, linking each to the Layer‑3 strategy and SpecKit tasks in preparation for implementation.
- **Learning**: Layer‑4 stubs give forthcoming code artifacts clear contracts, easing the docs↔code feedback loop.

## Turn 29: Shared Telemetry Relocation & Alias Fallout (Lines 3202-3335)
- **User** kicked off `npm run safe:commit` to validate the new benchmark scaffolding and reported Vitest module-resolution failures immediately after the run.
- **Copilot** relocated the inference accuracy tracker and URI normalizer into `packages/shared`, updated AST benchmarks to load the built tracker, and refreshed the Layer‑3/Layer‑4 docs so future benchmark work targets the shared implementation path.
- **Learning**: Moving telemetry primitives into a shared package demands synchronized path aliases across server and test layers or Vitest will surface `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` cascades.

## Turn 30: Regex-Based Vitest Resolver Fix (Lines 3336-3525)
- **User** reran the safe-commit pipeline, confirming the alias errors persisted despite the initial resolver tweak.
- **Copilot** rewrote `vitest.config.ts` to apply regex aliases that map both the root `@copilot-improvement/shared` entry and all `@copilot-improvement/shared/*` subpaths directly to `packages/shared/src`, restoring the unit suites.
- **Learning**: Alias rewrites must avoid naive string concatenation; regex-based transforms keep nested imports pointed at the intended source tree.

## Turn 31: Integration Harness Collapse Diagnosed (Lines 3526-3705)
- **User** supplied the integration failure log showing extension activation crashes, missing benchmark fixtures, and a VS Code spawn ENOENT.
- **Copilot** audited shared exports, benchmark specs, and the snapshot CLI to trace why the harness could not locate built assets or launch the VS Code binary inside `.vscode-test`.
- **Learning**: Integration benchmarks require deterministic repo-root resolution and VS Code bootstrap wiring; without them every suite depending on the extension host fails up front.

## Turn 32: Benchmark Harness Refactor & Documentation (Lines 3706-3960)
- **User** asked for a holistic plan to address the failing integration benchmarks.
- **Copilot** introduced `tests/integration/benchmarks/utils/repoPaths.ts`, updated the AST and rebuild benchmarks plus `benchmarkRecorder.ts` to use stable repo-relative paths and Electron flags, refreshed the MDMD docs, and reran `npm run test:unit` to validate the refactor.
- **Learning**: Centralizing repo-path discovery and documenting the runtime expectations keeps benchmarks portable between local runs and VS Code’s integration harness.

## Turn 33: Integration Recovery & Rebuild Benchmark Investigation (Lines 3961-4401)
- **User** reran the integration suite, confirming every scenario passed except `T057` (graph rebuild stability), which exited with code 9.
- **Copilot** dove into the remaining failure by executing the snapshot CLI repeatedly, diffing generated fixtures, probing workspace indexers, and instrumenting temporary debug scripts, but the root cause of the non-zero exit remains open.
- **Learning**: The rebuild-stability benchmark still needs deterministic snapshot orchestration; additional instrumentation is required before the benchmark can join the passing suite.

## Turn 34: Coverage Scope Trim & Graph Audit Remediation (Lines 4402-5601)
- **User** highlighted the minute-long post-test stall and enormous coverage tables caused by Vitest traversing the bundled VS Code runtime inside `.vscode-test/`.
- **Copilot** first swapped the reporter to `text-summary`, then—after rehydrating the 3970-4401 transcript—tightened `vitest.config.ts` includes to `packages/**/src/**/*` and excluded fixture, workspace, and coverage directories, restoring fast runs and yielding realistic coverage percentages.
- **User** validated the faster runs but noted the coverage totals shifted sharply; they shared a `safe:commit` log where `graph:audit` flagged missing docs for benchmark helpers plus absent symbol references for the shared inference-accuracy types.
- **Copilot** reread MDMD instructions, authored Layer-4 docs (`.mdmd/layer-4/testing/benchmarks/{repoPathsHelper,benchmarkRecorder,tsBasicFixture}.mdmd.md`) and refreshed existing benchmark telemetry docs to wire the new artifacts, iteratively running `graph:snapshot`/`graph:audit` until file-level coverage cleared.
- **Copilot** used `npm run graph:inspect -- --file packages/shared/src/telemetry/inferenceAccuracy.ts` to analyze remaining symbol gaps, updated `.mdmd/layer-4/server-telemetry/inferenceAccuracyTracker.mdmd.md` to reference the outstanding interfaces, and re-ran audits until symbol coverage hit 100%, after which `npm run safe:commit` succeeded.

## Turn 35: SlopCop Cleanup & Commit Readiness (Lines 5602-6623)
- **User** cycled `safe:commit` repeatedly as SlopCop flagged broken markdown links and missing anchors introduced by the new benchmark docs.
- **Copilot** replaced forward-looking file links with inline references, corrected fixture doc paths to match generated assets, and fixed Phase‑7 anchors across benchmark/telemetry MDMD files, rerunning `slopcop:markdown`, `slopcop:symbols`, and the full `safe:commit` to confirm zero findings; the working tree stayed dirty only with intentional code/doc updates and chat history.
- **User** requested a commit prep review, prompting Copilot to reread the telemetry tracker, shared exports, URI helpers, benchmark harnesses, and fixtures, then mark Spec-Kit tasks T057, T058, and T061 complete to mirror the delivered benchmarks.
- **Copilot** drafted the commit message summarizing the benchmark telemetry documentation and SlopCop anchor cleanup, and logged tomorrow’s follow-up: explore wiring a workspace-local Ollama entry point so integration runs stop emitting “No eligible language models” warnings while other extensions remain disabled.
