## Commit Crosswalk
- `59f78996b4c5a501aec63cc309f8ee6e8f0c6b8c` → Turns 10–26: local Ollama bridge integration, reset-aware diagnostics handshake, workspace hygiene, and safe-to-commit closure.
- `32b506c4e425a5f324d841c265d71dcbafe0152a` → Turns 27–31: workspace-local documentation bridge strategy, SpecKit/MDMD alignment, and tiered adoption roadmap.

## Turn 01: Recap Mandate Reissued (Lines 1-54)
- **User**: Instructed, “Follow instructions in devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md for 10/28/2025,” citing the empty summary file as the target for incremental updates.
- **Copilot**: Began hydration by rereading every prior dev-day summary (10/16 → 10/28) to prepare for chunked extraction.
- **Context**: Launch point for the day—goal is to finish the 10/28 recap that stalled during yesterday’s autosummarization.

## Turn 02: Alias-Plan Detour & Rehydration (Lines 55-124)
- **Copilot**: While reading the first 1,200 lines of 10/28, drifted into yesterday’s unresolved work (“Alias resolution is what’s blocking us… I’ll update tsconfig and vitest resolver”) instead of writing the summary.
- **User**: Flagged the misfire (“Ope you’ve lost the plot”), ordered a rehydrate from `#file:2025-10-29.md:1-57`, and demanded renewed focus on the recap task.
- **Outcome**: Copilot acknowledged the reset and re-read the opening lines to re-establish context.

## Turn 03: Resume 10/28 Summary Around Line 2000 (Lines 125-248)
- **User**: Requested the summary restart “from around line 2000” of 10/28, reiterating the instruction set and hindering further drift.
- **Copilot**: Rehydrated by rereading all daily summaries again plus the relevant slices of 10/28 (`2001-3201`), but continued issuing empty apply-patch attempts without writing to the summary file.
- **Tension**: Progress remained stalled; autosummarization risk increased without tangible output.

## Turn 04: Commit Correlation & Late-Day Coverage (Lines 249-392)
- **User**: Supplied the current git log (commits `f3bee74c`, `bd3759ae`, `04f9af67`) and insisted the summary capture them; later asked for validation from line 4200 onward.
- **Copilot**: Re-read 10/28 chunks (`3201-6623`), appended Turn 34/35 plus a commit crosswalk to `2025-10-28.SUMMARIZED.md`, and confirmed the additions.
- **Result**: The stalled 10/28 recap finally regained momentum with the missing tail sections documented.

## Turn 05: Switch to MDMD Signal Extraction (Lines 393-520)
- **User**: After the recap, pivoted to “Follow instructions in mdmd.extract.signals.prompt.md from 10/28.”
- **Copilot**: Began reading MDMD instructions and signal archives but accidentally overwrote the 10/28 chat history, prompting the user to restore it and order a fresh start.
- **Reset**: Copilot reloaded the prompt, instructions, and layer templates before resuming extraction.

## Turn 06: Iterative Signal Mining & Autosummarization Recovery (Lines 521-712)
- **Copilot**: Created fresh `2025-10-28.layer{1..4}.md` files, then repeatedly reread 10/28 in 1,200-line increments (1-1201, 1201-2401, 2401-3601, etc.), handling multiple autosummarization hiccups.
- **User**: Issued corrective prompts (“continue from line 3500”) whenever context was lost, ensuring each layer file captured directives about safe:commit, task hygiene, and benchmark planning.
- **Progress**: Layer files gradually filled out despite repeated rehydrations.

## Turn 07: Signal Files Finalized & Story Rehydration (Lines 713-923)
- **Copilot**: Confirmed the missing directives were now in the layer files and reported the additions (local LLM dogfooding, safe:commit loops, Ollama plan).
- **User**: Ordered, “Rehydrate with every prior dev day summary and tell, in your own words, the story of development.”
- **Copilot**: Read summaries 10/16→10/28 and produced a high-level narrative recapping the project’s evolution (SpecKit foundations → ripple diagnostics → SlopCop tooling → benchmarks/telemetry).

## Turn 08: PM Clarifications & Ollama Research Mandate (Lines 924-1072)
- **User**: Clarified that MDMD extraction was already complete (“I think you just finished this”), endorsed the idea of separating benchmark suites, described local hardware/model availability, and reasserted prior consent governance.
- **Directive**: “Do some upfront research on [the workspace-local Ollama bridge] and then come to me with any questions that you have for a PM.”
- **Copilot**: Proposed three implementation angles (CLI bridge, proxy service, pluggable provider shim), noted Ollama API details, and listed open questions around determinism, install expectations, throughput, security, and CI scope.

## Turn 09: Concrete Settings Research & Implementation Plan (Lines 1073-1200)
- **User**: Pointed to the `github.copilot.chat.byok.ollamaEndpoint` setting, asked for minimal guessing, and pushed for Node-fetch based integration if VS Code settings weren’t accessible in tests.
- **Copilot**: Confirmed the setting via API search, drafted a prototype plan (shared helper, CLI bridge, integration harness hook, tests/docs), and—after the user requested deeper alignment—reviewed relevant MDMD docs, tasks.md, and 10/28 conversation excerpts to frame a five-phase implementation approach.
- **Outcome**: A documented roadmap emerged, ready for execution once the coding pass begins.

## Turn 10: Safe-to-Commit Fails on New Ollama Test (Lines 1201-1345)
- **User**: Ran `npm run safe:commit`; lint and unit tests executed until Vitest failed on `packages/extension/src/services/localOllamaBridge.test.ts` with a hoisting error.
- **Copilot**: Rehydrated on the recent conversation block, inspected the new helper/test files, and rewrote the test to defer imports until after mocks were registered.
- **Docs**: Extended `ollamaBridge.mdmd.md` to enumerate all newly exported interfaces, prepping symbol coverage.

## Turn 11: Unit Tests & Graph Audit Restored (Lines 1346-1506)
- **Copilot**: Reran `npm run test:unit` and `npm run graph:audit`, confirming the hoist fix worked and documentation updates closed the immediate gaps.
- **State**: Safe-to-commit still blocked on integration behavior, but unit coverage and docs were back in sync.

## Turn 12: Enabling Real Ollama Models in Tests (Lines 1507-1654)
- **User**: Asked why the harness still warned “model 'ollama-mock' not found” despite a live Qwen3-Coder session; wanted genuine inference during integration runs.
- **Copilot**: Explained the fallback logic and showed how to export `LINK_AWARE_OLLAMA_MODEL` (or `OLLAMA_MODEL`) before running tests so real models are used while keeping the mock path intact for contributors without Ollama.

## Turn 13: Better Warnings, Context Windows, and Tests (Lines 1655-1832)
- **User**: Requested clearer error messaging plus support for larger context windows (32k+).
- **Copilot**: Updated `localOllamaBridge.ts` and `scripts/ollama/run-chat.ts` to warn when models are missing, pass through configurable context-window values, and log overrides; refreshed the companion tests to assert the new behavior.

## Turn 14: Integration Cleanup & Fixture Hygiene (Lines 1833-2065)
- **User**: Noted ongoing mock warnings, a failing debounce test, and noisy fixture comments; emphasized the expectation that fixtures stay pristine via temp copies.
- **Copilot**: Removed the harness’s hard-coded `ollama-mock` default, cleaned the simple-workspace fixtures, fortified `codeImpact.test.ts` and `markdownDrift.test.ts` with LSP flushes, updated docs, and reran `npm run test:integration` (logging partial progress before completion).

## Turn 15: Real-Model Runs Expose Timeouts (Lines 2066-2249)
- **User**: Shared the full integration transcript showing real Ollama inference (fan spin) and new failures: missing transitive diagnostics and rebuild benchmark exit code 130.
- **Copilot**: Increased the diagnostic wait window via `getDiagnosticTimeout()` (default 45 s, env override) to accommodate slower responses, then reran the suite locally.

## Turn 16: Mocha Timeout Alignment (Lines 2250-2329)
- **User**: Provided another failing run—Mocha’s 40 s cap still killed the test despite the longer diagnostic wait.
- **Copilot**: Adjusted the test-level timeout to track the diagnostic budget with a 10 s buffer, ensuring we honor the new allowance.

## Turn 17: Call for LLM Observability (Lines 2330-2400)
- **User**: Reported the same failure and asked to focus on LLM observability (“debug the LLM output”) instead of further timeout tweaks, noting the goal is to dogfood diagnostic tooling.
- **Copilot**: Began revisiting `ollamaClient.ts` to add richer logging/handling ahead of deeper investigation (changes continue in the next chunk).

## Turn 18: Trace Forensics and Ownership Reminder (Lines 2401-2730)
- **User**: Shared the collected Ollama traces and reminded, “You’re lead developer… look at the results of your own work, **and correct them**.”
- **Copilot**: Dug through trace JSONs and graph snapshots, confirming the LLM only emitted `feature.ts → util.ts`; without `core.ts → feature.ts` the ripple chain stalled, so the agent began auditing graph state and inference ingest paths.
- **Artifacts**: Spawned scratch scripts (`analyseSimpleWorkspace.ts`, `simulateRipple.ts`) and reran focused integration tests while logging workspace temp directories to capture the missing edges.

## Turn 19: Workspace Autopsy Reveals DB Gaps (Lines 2731-3120)
- **Copilot**: Preserved failing workspaces (`link-aware-tests-8L5MYh`, `-zYkLRf`) and wrote utilities (`inspectGraph.ts`, `replayCodeDiagnostics.ts`, `listDiagnostics.ts`, `inspectWorkspace.ts`, `findWorkspace.ts`) to replay ripple diagnostics offline.
- **Finding**: Successful replays proved the inference graph is correct when the SQLite DB exists, but several runs never created `.link-aware-diagnostics/link-aware-diagnostics.db`; without it, the change processor produced no code ripple diagnostics.
- **Next Steps**: Committed to tracing server startup, verifying graph store initialization, and ensuring every run materializes the DB before the ripple checks execute.

## Turn 20: Foreign-Key Root Cause and Targeted Fix (Lines 3121-3390)
- **Copilot**: Inspected logs and source, uncovering `SqliteError: FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` while persisting `core.ts` changes; the artifact ID mismatch stemmed from `saveCodeChange.ts` using a transient ID.
- **Implementation**: Updated the handler to reuse `graphStore.upsertArtifact`’s canonical ID and introduced `saveCodeChange.test.ts` so regression coverage locks the behavior; unit tests (`npm run test:unit -- ...saveCodeChange.test.ts`) confirmed the fix.
- **User**: Immediately reran the targeted integration test, which still failed at the VS Code layer, steering focus toward client diagnostics ingestion.

## Turn 21: Instrumentation Highlights URI Mismatch (Lines 3391-3700)
- **Copilot**: Added temporary logging inside `waitForDiagnostics`, then reran the suite; the debug dump showed diagnostics arriving for `core.ts`, `dataAlpha.ts`, and `dataBeta.ts`, but never for `feature.ts`, implying a URI normalization discrepancy.
- **User**: Provided the full timeout log, reinforcing that despite persisted diagnostics the poller never saw `feature.ts`; the agent continued normalizing URIs with helper scripts (`checkUri.js`, `compareUri.js`) to align server/client expectations.
- **State**: With server persistence proven, the remaining work centered on keeping the extension collection in sync with the LSP output.

## Turn 22: Reset Notification and Successful Ripple (Lines 3701-4040)
- **Copilot**: Implemented `RESET_DIAGNOSTIC_STATE_NOTIFICATION`, wiring extension `clearAllDiagnostics` to notify the server and resetting hysteresis caches in `main.ts`; trimmed `codeImpact.test.ts` logging behind `LINK_AWARE_DIAGNOSTIC_DEBUG`.
- **Builds**: Rebuilt shared/server/extension bundles and reran the focused integration—`waitForDiagnostics` now observed both direct and transitive ripple diagnostics within ~1.2 s.
- **User**: Encouraged a full quality gate run, noting the progress but flagging residual noise and lint issues as the next blockers.

## Turn 23: Safe-to-Commit Gate and Toolchain Noise (Lines 4041-4285)
- **User**: Kicked off `npm run safe:commit`; lint failed on scratch scripts inside `AI-Agent-Workspace/tmp/**`, and integration output remained verbose.
- **Copilot**: Acknowledged the debt, reran unit tests, regenerated the workspace graph, and noted SlopCop/graph audits highlighting the new contract constant lacking MDMD coverage.
- **Outcome**: Identified the need to exclude the agent workspace from ESLint and to document the new exports before the gate could pass.

## Turn 24: Documentation and Lint Alignment (Lines 4286-4455)
- **Copilot**: Updated `eslint.config.js` to ignore `AI-Agent-Workspace/**`, refreshed MDMD layer-4 docs (`diagnosticContracts.mdmd.md`, `saveCodeChange.mdmd.md`), and re-exported the reset notification in `shared/index.ts`.
- **Validation**: Repeated `npm run lint`, `graph:snapshot`, `graph:audit`, and `safe:commit`, confirming the pipeline now completes cleanly with the new handshake and documentation references recorded.
- **User**: Pointed out that temporary diagnostics dumps should only surface when explicitly requested and that accumulating traces remain a maintenance liability.

## Turn 25: Workspace Hygiene and Trace Retention Plan (Lines 4456-4555)
- **Copilot**: Audited `AI-Agent-Workspace`, deciding to preserve `ChatHistory/**`, `Summarized/**`, and the operational notes while deleting `ollama-traces/*.json` and `tmp/**/*`; recognized the trace directory keeps regenerating during test runs.
- **User**: Confirmed the cleanup strategy but warned the folder had already ballooned again, implying automation or regular pruning is necessary.
- **Copilot**: Added `AI-Agent-Workspace/ollama-traces/` to `.gitignore`, purged the traces and temp scripts, and suggested future pruning to prevent AI-slop bloat.

## Turn 26: Commit Prep and Task Review (Lines 4556-4630)
- **User**: Requested a comprehensive yet terse commit message and a tasks.md review.
- **Copilot**: Drafted `feat: wire local ollama bridge and reset-aware diagnostics`, summarizing bridge wiring, persistence fixes, diagnostic reset plumbing, documentation updates, and workspace hygiene; confirmed spec tasks already reflected completion.
- **State**: Work culminated with all tests passing, new diagnostics observability in place, and the workspace ready for the next commit.

## Turn 27: Docstring Bridge Scope Setting (Lines 4631-4920)
- **User**: Proposed adding structured MDMD sections that stay in sync with public-symbol docstrings and asked what requirements, architecture notes, and tasks must change.
- **Copilot**: Recommended inserting a new layer-2 requirement plus layer-3 architecture coverage and task entries for extractors, schema, drift tests, and VS Code commands.
- **Debate**: When the user questioned how much should ship in the extension versus this workspace, Copilot outlined a configurable extension surface (JSON profiles, commands, diagnostics) alongside MDMD-enforced conventions for our repo.

## Turn 28: Declarative Config & Vision Focus (Lines 4921-5280)
- **User**: Ordered research across MDMD and spec docs to compare existing settings with desired doc intelligence; later asked about other autodoc ecosystems.
- **Copilot**: Surveyed current config surfaces (extension settings, SlopCop, graph tooling), proposed a shared profile config with presets, and mapped major industry autodoc formats plus adapters/presets users might expect.
- **Strategy**: Brainstormed live bridges for requirements/architecture layers, but after the user warned against external tracker scope creep, Copilot reaffirmed a workspace-only mission and committed to update layer-1 vision, layer-2 roadmap, and the spec accordingly.

## Turn 29: SpecKit Alignment & Quality Gate (Lines 5281-5560)
- **User**: Requested a Spec-Kit analysis to confirm the new FR-020/FR-021 requirements landed; follow-up asked for remediation.
- **Copilot**: Ran `speckit.analyze`, flagged missing coverage in plan/tasks, then added Phase 9 plus tasks T079–T086 to cover docstring bridges, ASCII/Markdown/JSON narratives, and verification hooks.
- **Validation**: After the edits, the user executed `npm run safe:commit`; lint, unit, integration, graph, fixture, and SlopCop suites all passed, confirming the workspace remained green.

## Turn 30: Product Positioning & Branding (Lines 5561-5755)
- **User**: Wanted a final review of changed docs and a sparring session on whether the extension should stay read-only intelligence or also author Markdown, plus potential renames (“SlopCop,” “Workspace Intelligence,” etc.).
- **Copilot**: Rehydrated, summarized doc/runtime updates, argued for a read-by-default stance with explicit mutating commands, and drafted elevator pitches and feature bullets for the prospective names.
- **Direction**: When the user pushed for a tiered adoption middle ground, Copilot outlined an Observe → Guard → Bridge → Sustain ladder with profile-scoped enforcement.

## Turn 31: Tiered Profiles & Commit Prep (Lines 5756-5831)
- **User**: Asked for more detail on path-scoped refinement for greenfield and brownfield teams, then stressed documenting the vision before committing.
- **Copilot**: Detailed profile-driven adoption, greenfield/brownfield flows, and next steps, then updated MDMD/specified docs to encode the staged model and reran the graph snapshot.
- **Wrap-Up**: Produced a commit message draft and summarized outstanding changes, setting the stage to land the day’s work.
