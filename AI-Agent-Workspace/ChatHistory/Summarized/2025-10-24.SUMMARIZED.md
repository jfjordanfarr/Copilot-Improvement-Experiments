---

## Turn 01: Day 8 Kickoff & Prior-Day Recap (Lines 1–260)
- **User** asked for an auditable turn-by-turn recap of 10/23; **Copilot** ingested all prior summaries and authored `2025-10-23.SUMMARIZED.md`, linking commits and active story threads.
- **Artifacts**: `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-23.SUMMARIZED.md`.
- **Learning**: Daily compressed summaries remain the anchor for autosummarization windows.

## Turn 02: Framing T067 & MDMD-First Strategy (Lines 261–520)
- **User** positioned T067 (symbol-neighbor CLI) and reiterated the MDMD-first workflow; **Copilot** rehydrated SpecKit and MDMD layers to outline the implementation plan.
- **Artifacts**: None yet—design discovery pass across `.mdmd`, `specs`, and shared contracts.
- **Learning**: Maintaining alignment between specs and MDMD expedites later automation steps.

## Turn 03: MDMD Docs & CLI Skeleton (Lines 521–1030)
- **Copilot** created `inspectSymbolNeighborsCli.mdmd.md`, scaffolded `scripts/graph-tools/inspect-symbol.ts`, and added npm wiring via `graph:inspect` (with `tsx`) plus usage documentation in `quickstart.md`.
- **Artifacts**: `.mdmd/layer-4/tooling/inspectSymbolNeighborsCli.mdmd.md`, CLI script, package.json/task updates, doc refreshes.
- **Tests**: `npm run lint`, `npm run graph:inspect -- --help`, `npm run graph:inspect -- -- --list-kinds`.
- **Learning**: Document-first approach clarified CLI ergonomics (Windows `-- --` forwarding) before coding.

## Turn 04: Maintainer Instructions & Dogfooding Hooks (Lines 1031–1380)
- **Copilot** updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, Layer-3 surfaces, and quickstart to bake the CLI into onboarding; **User** encouraged turning the tooling into repeatable maintainer tasks.
- **Artifacts**: Maintainer doc updates, VS Code task entries.
- **Learning**: Capturing CLI workflows in instructions ensures future agents dogfood the tool consistently.

## Turn 05: Graph Coverage Audit Design & Implementation (Lines 1381–2050)
- **Copilot** authored `graphCoverageAudit.mdmd.md`, implemented `scripts/graph-tools/audit-doc-coverage.ts`, and added `graph:audit` npm/VS Code tasks. The audit emits JSON/human summaries and fails when coverage gaps exist.
- **Tests**: `npm run lint`, `npm run graph:audit -- -- --help`, `npm run graph:audit` (expected failure without cache).
- **Learning**: Structured exit codes plus JSON output make the audit CI-friendly despite current failures.

## Turn 06: Workspace Snapshot Automation (Lines 2051–2530)
- **User** requested automatic fixture generation; **Copilot** delivered `snapshot-workspace.ts`, wiring `graph:snapshot`, adding docs (`workspaceGraphSnapshot.mdmd.md`), `.gitignore` tweaks, and regenerating `data/graph-snapshots/workspace.snapshot.json`.
- **Artifacts**: Snapshot script/doc/task, refreshed fixture, `.link-aware-diagnostics.db` workflow.
- **Tests**: `npm run lint`, `npm run graph:snapshot`, `npm run graph:audit` (reporting 41 code gaps & 17 doc orphans).
- **Learning**: Deterministic snapshot + audit loop enables reproducible coverage checks.

## Turn 07: Verifying Audit Output & Enhancing Reports (Lines 2531–2920)
- **User** preserved audit logs and asked for interpretation; **Copilot** explained code/doc orphan semantics, proposed grouping by package, and brainstormed allowlists and symbol-level plans.
- **Artifacts**: Iterative updates to `audit-doc-coverage.ts` yielding grouped output.
- **Learning**: Grouped reporting turns raw gap lists into actionable work queues while paving path to configs.

## Turn 08: Broadening Vision Beyond MDMD (Lines 2921–3260)
- **User** challenged MDMD-centric bias; **Copilot** outlined the roadmap toward generic plaintext ingestion, symbol-level edges, and change detection; consensus formed around leveraging LLM extraction instead of bespoke parsers.
- **Artifacts**: Planning notes only.
- **Learning**: Future graph ingest must treat any plaintext (docs, specs, code comments) as first-class, with LLMs extracting relationships.

## Turn 09: Spec & MDMD Updates for LLM Ingestion (Lines 3261–3720)
- **Copilot** added FR-019 and Phase 8 to `spec.md`/`plan.md`, expanded `tasks.md` (T069–T073), and refreshed `research.md`. New docs captured GraphRAG-inspired ingestion architecture (`.mdmd/layer-3/llm-ingestion-pipeline.mdmd.md` and three Layer-4 briefs for orchestrator/extractor/calibrator).
- **Artifacts**: SpecKit & MDMD updates under `.mdmd/layer-4/llm-ingestion/` and `.mdmd/layer-3/`.
- **Learning**: Aligning specs/docs before coding keeps LLM ingestion work traceable.

## Turn 10: Prompt & Shared Inference Modules (Lines 3721–4460)
- **Copilot** created `relationshipTemplate.ts`, added shared inference modules (`relationshipExtractor.ts`, `confidenceCalibrator.ts`, tests), and updated shared exports and GraphStore schema to accept confidence enums.
- **Artifacts**: `packages/server/src/prompts/llm-ingestion/relationshipTemplate.ts`, shared LLM modules/tests, GraphStore updates.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`, targeted Vitest runs (extractor/calibrator suites).
- **Learning**: Confidence scores now map to categorical bands, ready for UI filtering.

## Turn 11: Orchestrator Implementation & Unit Coverage (Lines 4461–5200)
- **Copilot** implemented `llmIngestionOrchestrator.ts` with dry-run snapshot support, added fixtures (`tests/integration/us5/__fixtures__/llm-ingestion/dry-run.sample.json`), and wrote unit tests verifying provenance & confidence calibration.
- **Artifacts**: Orchestrator + tests, fixture, package export updates.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`, `npm run build`.
- **Learning**: Dry-run mode allows auditing LLM output without mutating the graph.

## Turn 12: Vetting Story Alignment & Next Steps (Lines 5201–5600)
- **User** confirmed readiness to proceed, raised whether to commit fixture, and green-lit continuing toward integration coverage.
- **Artifacts**: Planning only (commit deferred to user).
- **Learning**: Fixture retention remains a judgement call per repo hygiene.

## Turn 13: Unit Regression – KnowledgeFeedManager Timing (Lines 5601–6500)
- `npm run verify` revealed a flaky `KnowledgeFeedManager` test (status not yet degraded). **Copilot** added an async `waitForStatus` helper polling the collected feed diagnostics before asserting, stabilizing the unit run.
- **Artifacts**: `knowledgeFeedManager.test.ts` updated with wait helper.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit` (pass), `npm run verify` (unit suite passes but integration not yet reached).
- **Learning**: Asynchronous services demand deterministic waits instead of fixed sleeps.

## Turn 14: LSIF Parser Noise Suppression (Lines 6501–7100)
- **User** surfaced persistent stderr noise; **Copilot** wrapped the malformed-line scenario in `lsifParser.test.ts` with a `console.warn` spy to silence expected warnings, restoring clean vitest output.
- **Artifacts**: `lsifParser.test.ts` sedation.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`, `npm run verify` (still halting post-units).
- **Learning**: Tests should suppress intentional logging to keep CI signal clear.

## Turn 15: Verify Pipeline Finally Runs Integration (Lines 7101–7800)
- After integrating the async wait, `npm run verify` advanced to integration tests, rebuilding Electron-native `better-sqlite3` and executing all US1–US5 suites with one pending spec. The user confirmed full success; Copilot summarized outcomes and proposed next tasks (T069–T072 completion, audit allowlists, symbol-level extraction prototype).
- **Artifacts**: None beyond test outputs.
- **Tests**: `npm run verify` (lint ✓, rebuild ✓, unit ✓, integration ✓ with 17 passing/1 pending).
- **Learning**: Stability hinges on robust unit tests—once they pass reliably, verify flows to integration as expected.

## Turn 16: Commit Prep & Backlog Options (Lines 7801–8100)
- **User** considered whether to include `dry-run.sample.json` in the upcoming commit; **Copilot** reviewed the fixture (retained) and reiterated the top-three development branches (LLM dry-run integration, audit allowlist, symbol extraction prototype).
- **Artifacts**: Planning acknowledgement, no commit recorded within log.
- **Learning**: Clear next-step menu keeps momentum post-checkpoint.

## Tests & Tooling Highlights
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run graph:inspect` (with `-- -- --list-kinds`)
- `npm run graph:audit` (human + JSON modes)
- `npm run graph:snapshot`
- `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run verify`

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **Docs-first development**: Each major feature (CLI, audit, snapshot, LLM ingestion) started with MDMD/spec updates before code, keeping traceability intact.
- **Self-dogfooding tooling**: Graph snapshot + audit commands promote continuous observability of doc coverage gaps.
- **LLM pipeline scaffolding**: Prompt templates, shared extractors, and orchestrator lay the groundwork for GraphRAG-style ingestion with confidence categories.
- **Test determinism**: Fixing async races and noisy logs (knowledge feed manager, LSIF parser) restored trust in `npm run verify`.
- **Workspace reproducibility**: Deterministic SQLite rebuilds, snapshot fixtures, and doc updates make CI-ready automation feasible.

## Salient Decisions
1. Track CLI/audit workflows in maintainer instructions so future agents rely on the same dogfood commands.
2. Generate deterministic workspace snapshots before audits to avoid staleness and enable fixture diffing.
3. Represent LLM confidence as categorical enums for downstream filtering and diagnostics gating.
4. Treat test logs as part of product polish—mock or suppress expected warnings to keep verify output actionable.

## Pending / Next Steps
- Implement T069–T072: run the orchestrator against dry-run fixtures, surface provenance, and add integration coverage for LLM ingestion.
- Introduce audit configuration (allowlists, severity controls) and begin whittling down code/doc orphan lists.
- Prototype symbol-level extraction (potentially via `vscode.lm`) to bridge from file relationships to fine-grained pseudocode AST insights.
- User to commit Day 8 changes (decision pending on `tests/integration/us5/__fixtures__/llm-ingestion/dry-run.sample.json`).
