## Turn 01: Daily Summary & Commit Audit (Lines 1–220)
- **User** kicked off Dev Day 6 by requesting the 10/21 recap; Copilot reread the prior log and drafted `2025-10-21.SUMMARIZED.md`, then corrected the commit correlation table after the user supplied the accurate git log.
- **Artifacts**: `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-21.SUMMARIZED.md`.
- **Learning**: Commit lineage must be verified against authoritative git output before publishing the daily digest.

## Turn 02: Hydration & Option Selection (Lines 221–520)
- **User** provided the historical summaries and asked for the next steps; Copilot rehydrated specs (`tasks.md`, `product-roadmap.mdmd.md`, `user-intent-census.md`) and proposed three options (A: finish US3 surfaces, B: knowledge-feed enrichment, C: noise filters), recommending Option A; user approved.
- **Artifacts**: None; planning pass only.
- **Learning**: Daily hydration across specs, MDMD, and tasks keeps roadmap alignment tight before coding resumes.

## Turn 03: Option A Execution – T044/T045 Close-Out (Lines 521–1180)
- **Copilot** cleared 15 lint violations, implemented the export diagnostics command (`exportDiagnostics.ts`), added unit coverage, marked T044/T045 complete in `tasks.md`, updated extension contributions, and committed the tranche; integration tests still had one pending scenario.
- **Tests**: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: `packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.{ts,test.ts}`, `packages/extension/package.json`, `packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts`, `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/tasks.md`.
- **Learning**: Export workflow plus lint hygiene sealed US3’s surface commitments ahead of knowledge-feed work.

## Turn 04: Option B Kickoff – LSIF/SCIP Ingestion (Lines 1181–1950)
- **Copilot** designed LSIF/SCIP contracts (`packages/shared/src/contracts/{lsif,scip}.ts`), wrote parsers (`lsifParser.ts`, `scipParser.ts`), built a feed format detector, wired detection into `knowledgeGraphBridge.ts`, and authored unit suites; lint/build initially failed due to contract mismatches and unguarded parsing but were resolved.
- **Tests**: `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: Parser implementations, detector module, tests (`lsifParser.test.ts`, `scipParser.test.ts`, `feedFormatDetector.test.ts`).
- **Learning**: Auto-detection allows newline-delimited LSIF, SCIP JSON, and native snapshots to coexist without manual configuration.

## Turn 05: Integration Harness & Workspace Index Overhaul (Lines 1951–2800)
- **Copilot** chased integration harness failures (rootDir complaints, stray compiled JS, `.gitignore` noise), introduced `.gitignore` rules for `src/**/*.js`, removed the temporary feedFormat integration test, and shifted the workspace indexer to a content-first policy (text sniffing, gitignore-style exclusions, path-hint enrichers). User flagged behaviour concerns; Copilot justified text-centric indexing with binary exclusions.
- **Tests**: `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration` (intermittent failures logged).
- **Artifacts**: `.gitignore`, `packages/server/src/features/knowledge/workspaceIndexProvider.ts`, `packages/server/src/features/knowledge/feedFormatDetector.ts` adjustments.
- **Learning**: Indexing by content type instead of rigid extension lists better supports MDMD and template assets.

## Turn 06: Better-SQLite3 Rebuild Discipline & Feed Readiness (Lines 2801–3600)
- **Copilot** optimized native rebuild paths (skip flag, command updates) but user observed persistent ABI mismatches; the agent added feed readiness checks (new LSP request, telemetry in `extension.ts`, `knowledgeFeeds.ts` updates) and instrumented integration logs while iterating on US5 failures.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration` (still red for US5), `npm run lint`.
- **Artifacts**: `packages/server/src/main.ts`, `packages/shared/src/contracts/diagnostics.ts`, `packages/extension/src/extension.ts`, `packages/server/src/runtime/knowledgeFeeds.ts`.
- **Learning**: Soft-waiting on feed health prevents diagnostics from racing ahead of ingestion, but ABI rebuild automation needed stronger guarantees.

## Turn 07: Static Feed Provider & Ripple Path Fixes (Lines 3601–4300)
- **Copilot** refactored static feed ingestion (`staticFeedWorkspaceProvider.ts`), normalized URI resolution, and improved ripple hint propagation; integration tests still failed on the US5 web.config hop, prompting additional graph bridging tweaks and path-hint augmentations. User highlighted the live Explorer notifications as a positive UX indicator.
- **Tests**: Repeated `npm run test:integration`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: `packages/server/src/features/knowledge/{staticFeedWorkspaceProvider.ts,knowledgeGraphBridge.ts,rippleAnalyzer.ts}`, fixture tweaks under `tests/integration/fixtures/simple-workspace`.
- **Learning**: Template-to-config ripples require consistent multi-hop edge generation across watcher seeds, external feeds, and runtime analyzers.

## Turn 08: Hardening Native Rebuild Workflow (Lines 4301–4850)
- **User** requested clean git diffs; Copilot cleaned generated artifacts, added log captures, and eventually changed strategy: forced Node rebuild via `rebuild:better-sqlite3:force`, guaranteed Electron rebuild before integration (runTests.ts), and ensured scripts ignore skip flags during verify.
- **Tests**: `npm run verify` (multiple iterations), `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`.
- **Artifacts**: `package.json` scripts, `scripts/rebuild-better-sqlite3.mjs`, `tests/integration/vscode/runTests.ts`.
- **Learning**: Deterministic rebuilds for both Node and Electron ABIs are mandatory before running unit/integration suites on Windows.

## Turn 09: Documentation & Script Polish (Lines 4851–5050)
- **Copilot** closed spec tasks T048–T050 by updating `quickstart.md` (delete/rebind flow, settings matrix), adding a consent-focused README, and wiring `npm run verify` into package scripts as the CI convenience command.
- **Tests**: Final `npm run verify` (green except for expected pending export test).
- **Artifacts**: `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/quickstart.md`, root `README.md`, `package.json` script section.
- **Learning**: Documenting consent gates and polished onboarding ensures future contributors understand rebuild steps and diagnostic governance.

## Turn 10: Open Threads & Wrap-Up (Lines 5051–5152)
- **User** queried the remaining pending integration test (ack export metadata); Copilot confirmed it is intentionally skipped until export metadata work lands, then scoped the next small-ticket opportunities for an end-of-day commit.
- **Artifacts**: None new.
- **Learning**: Capturing outstanding acceptance criteria inside pending tests keeps the regression net ready for the feature’s eventual implementation.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **Knowledge Feed Enrichment**: LSIF/SCIP import support plus format autodetection broaden graph coverage while preserving provenance.
- **Indexing by Content**: Text-sniffing, gitignore-aware workspace indexing, and path-hint heuristics replaced brittle extension lists, better supporting MDMD and template assets.
- **Deterministic Native Tooling**: Forced better-sqlite3 rebuilds for both ABIs eliminated flaky unit/integration runs on Windows.
- **Integration Observability**: Feed readiness telemetry, Explorer notifications, and richer logs accelerated diagnosis of ripple propagation gaps.
- **Doc & Consent Clarity**: Quickstart, README, and settings docs now reflect acknowledgement flows, delete/rebind UX, and rebuild expectations.

## Salient Decisions Ratified
1. **Option A before B**: close US3 surfaces (lint + export command) prior to knowledge feed expansion.
2. **Content-First Indexing**: treat nearly all text-like files as candidates while excluding binary noise, using heuristics for layer classification.
3. **Mandatory Native Rebuilds**: always rebuild better-sqlite3 for Node and Electron during verify/integration to avoid ABI drift.
4. **Feed Readiness Telemetry**: expose LSP readiness and log configured vs healthy feeds before serving diagnostics.
5. **Pending Export Test**: keep the acknowledgement-export integration test skipped until metadata wiring lands, preserving acceptance criteria without blocking CI.

## Next Phase
- Finish US5 transform ripple diagnostics by ensuring multi-hop path detection covers template → script → generated config edges and update `transformRipple.test.ts` to pass.
- Implement export-diagnostics acknowledgement metadata and un-skip the pending integration test.
- Extend content-first indexing with binary asset hashing so image/font drift participates in ripple analysis.
- Prepare README/quickstart follow-ups with the finalized rebuild + verify workflow once US5 is green.
