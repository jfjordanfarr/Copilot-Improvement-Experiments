## Turn 10: Option Review + Runtime Modularization Commit (Lines 2526-3070)
- **User** revisited Options A/B/C and asked for refactoring main.ts plus documentation.
- **Copilot** chose Option A (continue implementation), split main.ts responsibilities into `packages/server/src/runtime/*` modules, added `languageServerRuntime.mdmd.md`, ran lint/tests, and committed `refactor(server): modularize runtime bootstrap` while respecting <500 line guidance.
- **Artifacts**: packages/server/src/runtime/{environment,settings,knowledgeFeeds,changeProcessor}.ts, .mdmd/layer-4/language-server-runtime/languageServerRuntime.mdmd.md, streamlined main.ts.
- **Learning**: Modular runtime improves maintainability and satisfies instruction to avoid oversized files.

## Turn 11: Integrate Ripple Analyzer into Diagnostics (Lines 3071-3652)
- **User** endorsed continuing Option A.
- **Copilot** threaded `RippleAnalyzer` through `changeProcessor`, updated diagnostics publishers to consume precomputed ripple impacts, expanded runtime settings and provider guard to include ripple controls, refreshed tests, and confirmed all gates.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **Knowledge Graph Maturity**: Blueprint + implementation now cover ingestion, checkpoints, diagnostics gateway, and runtime wiring for external feeds.
- **Runtime Maintainability**: main.ts was decomposed into focused runtime modules, aligning with new guidelines on file size and clarity.
- **Ripple Intelligence**: Analyzer outputs now inform diagnostics with depth/path/confidence while heuristic path detection seeds the graph automatically.
- **Testing Discipline**: Every major feature landed with dedicated unit suites and repeated lint/test/build runs, maintaining trust in rapid iteration.
- **Traceability Culture**: Daily summaries, MDMD docs, and commit correlations reinforced the lab-notebook ethos valued by the user.

## Next Phase
- Surface ripple metadata inside the VS Code client (diagnostic hover, detail panels) and update tasks.md to close T041 formally.
- Expand integration tests to validate symbol + knowledge feed cooperation and ripple diagnostics end-to-end.
- Continue enriching knowledge feed sources (additional static descriptors, future workspace searches) to broaden the graph.
- Plan the follow-on spec items (e.g., T042+) once ripple UX and falsifiability gaps are addressed.
