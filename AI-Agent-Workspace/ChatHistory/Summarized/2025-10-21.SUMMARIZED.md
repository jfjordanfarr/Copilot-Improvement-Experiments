## Turn 11: Bottom-Up MDMD Sweep (Lines 4101–4585)
- **User** requested a bottom-up MDMD sweep to document remaining code modules, then a top-down sweep to capture all user intent from chat history.
- **Copilot** created Layer-4 briefs for extension services (`symbolBridge.mdmd.md`), settings (`configService.mdmd.md`), server diagnostics (`publishCodeDiagnostics.mdmd.md`, `hysteresisController.mdmd.md`, `diagnosticUtils.mdmd.md`), knowledge ingestion (`knowledgeGraphBridge.mdmd.md`), change events (`changeQueue.mdmd.md`, `saveDocumentChange.mdmd.md`, `saveCodeChange.mdmd.md`), and watchers (`fileMaintenanceWatcher.mdmd.md`, `linkAwareExtension.mdmd.md`).
- **Artifacts**: Expanded Layer-4 lattice covering key runtime modules.
- **Learning**: Documenting bottom-up ensures every implementation file has a corresponding MDMD brief for traceability.

## Turn 12: Top-Down User Intent Census (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **Copilot** searched all ChatHistory files for `jfjordanfarr:` prompts, created `AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/user-intent-census.md` organizing design-shaping prompts by dev day with source line ranges, and wired the census into Layer-1/Layer-2 MDMD docs.
- **Artifacts**: user-intent-census.md; updated vision and roadmap docs.
- **Learning**: Centralizing stakeholder guidance enables future threads to rehydrate user intent quickly across autosummarization windows.

## Turn 13: Locate Orphan Layer-4 Files (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** asked Copilot to identify any orphan MDMD docs or code files missing Layer-4 coverage using the new `tree_gitignore.py` script.
- **Copilot** identified gaps: extension commands/diagnostics/onboarding/prompts/services/settings modules, server changeEvents/dependencies/diagnostics/knowledge/settings/utils/watchers modules all lacked Layer-4 briefs; no orphaned MDMD files existed.
- **User** approved proceeding to complete the Layer-4 lattice.
- **Learning**: Systematic gap analysis prevents documentation drift as the codebase grows.

## Turn 14: Complete Layer-4 Lattice (Lines 4101–4585 continued)

- **Artifacts**: Full Layer-4 coverage for all runtime modules.
- **Learning**: Completing the lattice establishes bidirectional traceability from vision→implementation.

## Turn 15: MDMD Audit & Gap Remediation (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** requested ingesting all `*.mdmd.md` docs simultaneously to find inconsistencies, underspecification, or design improvements, outputting findings to a markdown note.
- **Copilot** created `AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/mdmd-audit-2025-10-21.md` identifying: (1) broken parent link in `docDiagnosticProvider.mdmd.md`, (2) outdated roadmap "forthcoming" note, (3) missing Layer-3 bridge docs for extension surfaces and language-server architecture, (4) need to clarify broken-link diagnostic payload inversion.
- **User** requested remediations.
- **Copilot** created `.mdmd/layer-3/extension-surfaces.mdmd.md` and `.mdmd/layer-3/language-server-architecture.mdmd.md`, fixed broken parent references, updated roadmap wording, and clarified diagnostic payload behavior; committed as "docs: add architecture bridge docs" then "docs: align layer-4 diagnostics docs".
- **Artifacts**: Layer-3 bridge docs, corrected Layer-4 parent links, aligned documentation.
- **Learning**: Holistic MDMD audits catch structural inconsistencies before they propagate into implementation.

## Turn 16: Crystallization & Next Dev Steps (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** praised MDMD's link-hub value for auditability and asked whether to continue dev or crystallize vision.
- **Copilot** recommended top-down MDMD crystallization first: sweep `jfjordanfarr:` utterances + spec docs for Layer-1 vision → Layer-2 roadmap, then invert with bottom-up Layer-4→Layer-3 bridges, noting gaps for future dev tasks.
- **User** expressed strong alignment and directed Copilot to proceed.
- **Copilot** authored `link-aware-diagnostics-vision.mdmd.md` (Layer 1), `product-roadmap.mdmd.md` (Layer 2), `diagnostics-pipeline.mdmd.md` (Layer 3), and backfilled Layer-4 briefs for doc diagnostics publisher, artifact watcher, and orphan maintenance.
- **Artifacts**: Complete MDMD stack from vision→implementation.
- **Learning**: Bidirectional MDMD crystallization (top-down + bottom-up) reveals architectural blind spots and UX gaps early.

## Turn 17: Safe-to-Commit Automation (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** reminded Copilot of the earlier task: create an IDE task or script to answer "am I safe to commit?"
- **Copilot** created `scripts/safe-to-commit.mjs`, a Node helper running `npm run verify` + `git status -sb` with a clear verdict, wired it into `package.json` via `safe:commit`, and added a "Safe to Commit" VS Code task.
- **Tests**: `npm run safe:commit` executed lint→unit→integration and reported git status; integration tests mutated fixtures.
- **Learning**: Lightweight commit-readiness automation reduces manual friction and keeps CI deterministic.

## Turn 18: Spec Status & Fixture Cleanup (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** approved spec status tweak (Draft→In Progress) before continuing.
- **Copilot** updated `spec.md` status, cleaned up mutated fixture files via `git checkout`, backfilled quickstart/spec with doc-drift behavior notes, and scaffolded `tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts` with skipped stubs.
- **Artifacts**: Spec status updated, fixtures stabilized, acknowledgement test skeleton.
- **Learning**: Keeping spec metadata current and fixtures clean maintains reproducibility.

## Turn 19: Fix Integration Test Fixture Pollution (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** requested fixing the test suite to avoid slow `git checkout` tool calls after every integration run.
- **Copilot** reworked `runTests.ts` to copy `simple-workspace` into a temporary directory (`fs.promises.cp` + `mkdtemp`) before launching VS Code, ensuring integration runs never dirty the repo; verified with `npm run test:integration` (15 passing, 2 pending).
- **Artifacts**: Updated runTests.ts; fixtures now stay clean.
- **Learning**: Copying fixtures into temp dirs eliminates repo churn and speeds up agentic iteration.

## Turn 20: Implement T043 Acknowledgement Service (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** greenlighted T043 (acknowledgement service).
- **Copilot** added acknowledgement persistence to `graphStore.ts` (artifact lookups, diagnostic retrieval, status updates), created `acknowledgementService.ts` with audit logging + hysteresis release, wired it into `main.ts`, added unit coverage (`acknowledgementService.test.ts`), threaded acknowledgement state through `changeProcessor.ts`, persisted diagnostic history with `change_event_id`, implemented emission guards in `publishDocDiagnostics.ts` and `publishCodeDiagnostics.ts`, and exposed `linkDiagnostics.acknowledgeDiagnostic` LSP contract.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: Acknowledgement service, persistence layer, LSP contract, updated publishers.
- **Learning**: Acknowledgement state now survives restarts and blocks repeat emissions until fresh change events.

## Turn 21: Extension Acknowledgement Command (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **Copilot** created `packages/extension/src/commands/acknowledgeDiagnostic.ts`, added "Acknowledge diagnostic" quick fix in `docDiagnosticProvider.ts`, plumbed record/target/trigger metadata through `LinkDiagnosticData` parsing, and centralized the command identifier to avoid string drift.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`.
- **Learning**: Quick fix actions in the Problems panel now trigger acknowledgement directly from diagnostics with record IDs.

## Turn 22: Integration Test for Acknowledgement Flow (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** requested integration tests to prove acknowledgement end-to-end.
- **Copilot** unskipped `acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts`, added end-to-end scenario (trigger doc ripple → acknowledge → verify diagnostic disappears → fresh change emits new record ID), hardened test harness with `clearDiagnostics`, `appendText`, and diagnostic polling utilities, tightened server unit tests for TypeScript safety.
- **Tests**: `npm run build`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`.
- **Learning**: US3 integration suite now catches acknowledgement flow regressions.

## Turn 23: T042/T043 Commit (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** confirmed readiness to commit T042/T043.
- **Copilot** checked off T042/T043 in `tasks.md`, staged changes, committed with chat history as "feat: implement acknowledgement service (T043) and integration test (T042)".
- **Artifacts**: Committed acknowledgement service + tests.
- **Learning**: Each task completion includes chat history for audit trail and future understanding.

## Turn 24: Option Weighing for Next Priority (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** requested comparing several options for next development steps based on spec, MDMD docs, and user-intent census.
- **Copilot** proposed: (1) finish US3 surfaces (T044/T045 tree view + export), (2) ship noise filter tuning (T046), (3) kick off knowledge-feed enrichment (T05x), or (4) instrument telemetry (T059), recommending **Option 1** to close FR-004/FR-005 triage UX before expanding scope.
- **User** approved Option 1.
- **Learning**: Explicit option weighing aligns development with roadmap priorities and MDMD architecture.

## Turn 25: Implement T044 Diagnostics Tree View (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **Copilot** added `DiagnosticsTreeDataProvider` in `diagnosticsTree.ts`, registered tree-specific acknowledge/refresh commands, exposed Explorer view contributions in `package.json`, created `listOutstandingDiagnostics.ts` server handler with unit coverage, hooked `linkDiagnostics/diagnostics/list` LSP request into `main.ts`.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: Diagnostics tree view, server support for listing diagnostics.
- **Learning**: Tree view surfaces active diagnostics with artifact metadata; acknowledge actions clear entries as expected.

## Turn 26: Node 22 Harmonization (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** reported extension activation failure due to `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch (Node 127 vs. Electron 136), asked to bump Node version to 22 to match VS Code.
- **Copilot** raised toolchain baseline to Node 22 by updating `.nvmrc`, `engines.node`, lockfile metadata, and project docs; created `rebuild-better-sqlite3.mjs` helper to fetch prebuilt binaries for current Node runtime, falling back to source build if needed.
- **Tests**: `npm run build`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: Node 22 alignment, native rebuild automation, committed as "feat: add diagnostics tree view and node 22 harmonization".
- **Learning**: Harmonizing Node versions across extension runtime and test suites eliminates ABI friction; prebuilt binaries speed up CI.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **MDMD Crystallization**: Bidirectional documentation sweep (top-down vision + bottom-up implementation briefs) revealed structural gaps and solidified traceability from user intent → code.
- **Falsifiability Discipline**: Integration test expansion (markdown link drift, scope collisions, transform ripple) plus "safe to commit" automation strengthened regression detection before expanding scope.
- **Acknowledgement Workflow**: End-to-end implementation (persistence, LSP contract, extension command, tree view, integration tests) closed FR-004/FR-005, enabling lead triage workflows.
- **Node 22 Harmonization**: Aligning Node runtime with VS Code's Electron ABI eliminated native module friction and simplified contributor onboarding.
- **Continuous Auditability**: Daily summaries, user intent census, chat history commits, and MDMD link hubs maintained provenance and reproducibility across sessions.

## Salient Decisions Ratified
1. **Falsifiability First** (Option B): formalize commit-readiness automation and expand integration coverage before adding new features.
2. **MDMD as Design Tool**: use layered markdown docs to plan tests, capture architecture, and audit consistency before implementation.
3. **Node 22 Baseline**: harmonize with VS Code's runtime to eliminate ABI thrash and simplify native dependency management.
4. **Acknowledgement Service**: persist diagnostic state with change-event linkage so acknowledgements survive restarts and suppress repeat emissions until fresh edits.
5. **Tree View Surfaces** (Option 1): prioritize lead triage UX (T044/T045) to close FR-004/FR-005 before expanding knowledge feeds or telemetry.

## Next Phase
- Complete T045 (export diagnostics command) to finish US3 surface requirements.
- Validate the diagnostics tree view renders active diagnostics and acknowledge actions clear entries in live extension testing.
- Expand US3 integration coverage once export command lands.
- Consider noise filter tuning (T046) or knowledge-feed enrichment (T05x) based on operational feedback from the tree view.
