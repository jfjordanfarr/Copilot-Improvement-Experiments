---

## Turn 01: Summary Kickoff (Lines 1-45)
- **User** reopened the project day requesting a turn-by-turn recap of 10/17 with git commit correlations and reuseable lineage.
- **Copilot** reread the prior log, harvested commit metadata, and produced `2025-10-17.SUMMARIZED.md` in the established 10:1, line-referenced style.
- **Artifacts**: AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-17.SUMMARIZED.md.
- **Learning**: Daily handoff docs must stay auditable so subsequent threads can fast-forward directly into implementation.

## Turn 02: Hysteresis Marching Orders (Lines 46-238)
- **User** praised the recap and effectively issued `/speckit.implement` for T033, insisting on spec hydration before coding.
- **Copilot** ingested spec/plan/tasks, authored `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/hysteresisController.ts`, wired acknowledgement APIs into `publishDocDiagnostics.ts`, added vitest coverage, and ran `npm run lint` plus `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: hysteresisController.ts, hysteresisController.test.ts, updated publishDocDiagnostics*, changeQueue/saveDocumentChange adjustments.
- **Learning**: Reciprocal markdown diagnostics now respect a suppression window, unlocking end-to-end hysteresis validation.

## Turn 03: Suggest Running Integrations (Lines 239-499)
- **User** requested an integration pass to exercise hysteresis.
- **Copilot** reran lint/unit suites, reported all six unit tests green, surfaced coverage deltas, and highlighted the need to rebuild the VS Code harness before hysteresis can be validated end-to-end.
- **Artifacts**: none new; executions confined to `npm run lint` and `npm run test:unit`.
- **Learning**: With hysteresis in place, the next risk lies in end-to-end wiring rather than unit coverage.

## Turn 04: Integration Harness Fails to Launch (Lines 500-602)
- **User** shared PowerShell logs showing `npm run test:integration` failing because `tests/integration/vscode/runTests.js` was missing and pressed for dogfooding.
- **Copilot** audited the integration folder, converted the runner to TypeScript (`runTests.ts`), added `tests/integration/vscode/tsconfig.json`, removed the `tsx` dependency, and ensured the command now builds the harness before invocation.
- **Artifacts**: tests/integration/vscode/tsconfig.json, rewritten runTests.ts, package.json dependency cleanup.
- **Learning**: The integration harness must self-compile to avoid stale JS artifacts when dogfooding via VS Code.

## Turn 05: QuickPick Breaks Automation (Lines 603-808)
- **User** described the new VS Code window prompting for workspace scope and emitting errors after a manual selection.
- **Copilot** inspected extension activation (providerGate, settingsBridge) and the onboarding flow to identify where interactive QuickPick prompts could be skipped during automated runs.
- **Artifacts**: adjustments queued for provider gating logic (no files yet altered in this slice).
- **Learning**: Deterministic tests require bypassing manual onboarding; the extension must auto-configure in test mode.

## Turn 06: Native Rebuild Trouble (Lines 809-852)
- **User** forwarded the "Diagnosing C++20 build failure" snippet indicating native build issues.
- **Copilot** chased the better-sqlite3 toolchain logs, confirming we need to manage Electron-vs-Node ABI rebuilds as integration harness spins up.
- **Artifacts**: investigative log notes only.
- **Learning**: The integration runner has to coordinate native module rebuilds or guard against ABI drift.

## Turn 07: UI Confirmation Loop (Lines 853-1109)
- **User** clarified the QuickPick persisted on both integration runs and blocked automation.
- **Copilot** short-circuited onboarding for the integration profile, updated `providerGate.ts` to auto-approve diagnostics in test mode, and reran integration to validate the headless path.
- **Artifacts**: providerGate.ts, settingsBridge.ts, extension activation wiring updates.
- **Learning**: Test harnesses must inject default configuration so extension prompts never stall CI.

## Turn 08: Feeling Ignored (Lines 1110-1149)
- **User** flagged a perceived lack of acknowledgement during the debugging spree.
- **Copilot** paused to outline the in-flight fixes (onboarding override, harness rebuild, hysteresis verification) and recommitted to more explicit play-by-play updates.
- **Artifacts**: communication only.
- **Learning**: Maintain a visible worklog even while heads-down on tooling to ensure situational awareness.

## Turn 09: Reconfirm Integration Pain (Lines 1150-1167)
- **User** reiterated the integration flow still required manual selection and crashed afterward.
- **Copilot** enumerated the pending adjustments (auto-configuration, host readiness command) and set expectations that subsequent harness runs would clear once wiring landed.
- **Artifacts**: none yet; commitments captured for upcoming patches.
- **Learning**: Before rerunning integrations, ensure gating logic updates are merged to avoid redundant failures.

## Turn 10: Greenlight to Continue (Lines 1168-1235)
- **User** granted Copilot latitude to continue implementation without further hand-holding.
- **Copilot** pushed through gating changes, refined onboarding logs, and prepped the integration runner for another attempt.
- **Artifacts**: providerGate.ts adjustments, extension configuration logs, updated tests/integration runner wiring.
- **Learning**: The automation path depends on the server exposing readiness (`isServerReady`) before clients proceed.

## Turn 11: Repetitive Terminal Noise (Lines 1236-1337)
- **User** delivered terminal output showing repeated prompts under the "prompt me each time" selection.
- **Copilot** traced the spam to the server readiness loop, adding deterministic configuration writes and instrumentation to verify host activation.
- **Artifacts**: settingsBridge logging tweaks, integration runner instrumentation.
- **Learning**: Retry loops need explicit termination once the extension completes onboarding.

## Turn 12: Extension Host Crash Log (Lines 1338-1508)
- **User** pasted VS Code extension host output from immediately before the crash.
- **Copilot** correlated the log with the missing `linkAwareDiagnostics.isServerReady` command, generated client/server shims so the command is registered during activation, and recompiled the harness.
- **Artifacts**: extension.ts activation wiring, server main.ts command registration.
- **Learning**: Exposing test-only server commands prevents harness shutdowns during readiness checks.

## Turn 13: Persistent Crash (Lines 1509-1612)
- **User** confirmed the crash persisted even after prior adjustments.
- **Copilot** dug deeper into the extension host logs, tightened the readiness promise resolution, and added additional telemetry to catch early failures.
- **Artifacts**: extension host logging improvements, server promise handling refinements.
- **Learning**: Diagnostics publication must wait on confirmed server boot; premature activation leaves VS Code without the registered commands.

## Turn 14: Optimistic Push (Lines 1613-1779)
- **User** encouraged continued effort toward getting the extension running inside the host.
- **Copilot** completed the readiness plumbing, ensured the server reports `isServerReady`, and reran integration until onboarding no longer requested user input.
- **Artifacts**: settingsBridge, extension.ts, server main.ts readiness scaffolding.
- **Learning**: Once onboarding is deterministic, we can proceed to more advanced fixture seeding.

## Turn 15: Approve Continue Prompt (Lines 1780-2008)
- **User** accepted the agent’s “Continue to iterate?” safety check.
- **Copilot** restructured workspace seeding via `workspaceIndexProvider`, added integration tsconfigs, invoked `npm run test:integration` repeatedly, and documented the need to ignore the generated SQLite snapshot.
- **Artifacts**: workspaceIndexProvider.ts expansion, tests/integration/tsconfig.json, updated runTests.ts, `.link-aware-diagnostics` snapshot (for review).
- **Learning**: The integration suite must bootstrap artifacts without preseeded databases to keep runs hermetic.

## Turn 16: Integration Success + DB Question (Lines 2009-2093)
- **User** shared the successful integration log (four US1 scenarios passing) and asked whether to commit the regenerated SQLite DB while highlighting Gemma 3:27B availability.
- **Copilot** advised ignoring the SQLite artifacts, outlined a staging plan for hysteresis + harness work, and suggested deleting `.link-aware-diagnostics` before commits.
- **Artifacts**: commit staging plan, gitignore recommendation (`*.db`).
- **Learning**: Regenerating the DB per run validates migrations and avoids binary churn in git.

## Turn 17: Git Hygiene Actions (Lines 2094-2118)
- **User** deleted the fixture DB directory, appended `*.db` to `.gitignore`, and requested confirmation.
- **Copilot** verified the clean slate, reran integration to ensure regeneration succeeds, and summarized the ready-to-commit diff.
- **Artifacts**: `.gitignore` update, refreshed `.link-aware-diagnostics` via test rerun.
- **Learning**: Automated regeneration keeps integration fixtures authoritative without tracking binaries.

## Turn 18: Post-Commit Direction (Lines 2119-2139)
- **User** confirmed committing "Add hysteresis controller and stabilize integration harness" and asked for next steps referencing spec docs.
- **Copilot** reread spec/plan/tasks, confirmed US1 hysteresis is complete, and recommended pivoting to the dependency graph pipeline (T034–T038).
- **Artifacts**: none yet; planning only.
- **Learning**: With hysteresis delivered, roadmap focus shifts to code-to-code ripple detection.

## Turn 19: Refocus on Code-to-Code (Lines 2140-2215)
- **User** reframed the vision: prioritize code-to-code ripple analysis, build a full workspace dependency tree, and treat documentation drift later.
- **Copilot** rewrote `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` to make US1 the code-to-code story, demoting documentation drift to US2, and updated integration test placement accordingly.
- **Artifacts**: specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, tests/integration/us2/markdownDrift.test.ts relocation.
- **Learning**: Specification realignment keeps the build focused on answering "What code files change together?" first.

## Turn 20: Greenlight for T034 Pipeline (Lines 2216-2398)
- **User** endorsed the spec changes, noted temporal context behavior, and asked Copilot to proceed with the outlined plan.
- **Copilot** surveyed fixtures and existing watchers, introduced `artifactWatcher.ts` to unify code+doc ingestion, migrated main.ts/persistence/diagnostics to the new watcher, and scaffolded new unit coverage.
- **Artifacts**: packages/server/src/features/watchers/artifactWatcher.ts (+test), main.ts wiring, saveDocumentChange.ts updates, publishDocDiagnostics.ts adjustments.
- **Learning**: Consolidating change ingestion by artifact type simplifies extending the pipeline to code files.

## Turn 21: Manual Deletion Request (Lines 2399-2404)
- **User** offered to delete legacy files after noticing the agent’s inability to remove `markdownWatcher` within reasoning traces.
- **Copilot** confirmed the exact files needing removal: `packages/server/src/features/watchers/markdownWatcher.ts` and its companion test.
- **Artifacts**: Deletion instructions.
- **Learning**: When tool calls cannot remove files, a manual assist keeps the refactor unblocked.

## Turn 22: Legacy Watcher Removed (Lines 2405-2474)
- **User** deleted the markdown watcher files.
- **Copilot** normalized references, expanded `artifactWatcher` coverage, rewired changeQueue/saveDocumentChange, ensured tests reference the new types, and added the replacement unit suite.
- **Artifacts**: artifactWatcher.ts/test refinements, changeQueue.ts/saveDocumentChange.ts adjustments, publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts updates.
- **Learning**: Stubbing the GraphStore in unit tests prevents native module loads, keeping tests decoupled from better-sqlite3.

## Turn 23: Better-Sqlite3 ABI Mismatch (Lines 2475-2644)
- **User** posted failing unit logs showing the native module ABI mismatch plus successful integration output for both US suites.
- **Copilot** generalized the ingestion pipeline around `artifactWatcher`, introduced GraphStore stubs to eliminate native loads, and confirmed both unit and integration suites run green.
- **Artifacts**: artifactWatcher.ts/test stubs, saveDocumentChange.ts adjustments, publishDocDiagnostics.ts/test alignments.
- **Learning**: Avoiding native binding loads in unit tests eliminates ABA rebuild thrash between Node and Electron.

## Turn 24: Document Rebuild Expectations (Lines 2645-2728)
- **User** shared updated Copilot instructions and asked where to document the better-sqlite3 rebuild workflow.
- **Copilot** added `npm run rebuild:better-sqlite3:node`, hooked it into `npm run test:unit`, and created `AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/better-sqlite3-rebuild.md` with PowerShell/POSIX instructions plus recovery steps.
- **Artifacts**: package.json script, AI-Agent-Workspace/Notes/better-sqlite3-rebuild.md.
- **Learning**: Embedding rebuild automation keeps native dependencies aligned across test environments.

## Turn 25: Commit + Next Item (Lines 2729-2752)
- **User** applauded the work, requested a commit, and asked for the next development/test plan.
- **Copilot** staged and committed "feat: generalize artifact watcher pipeline", summarized the diff, confirmed green tests, and outlined that T034 would build a dependency graph powering code-driven diagnostics.
- **Artifacts**: Git commit (feat: generalize artifact watcher pipeline), updated tasks.md summary.
- **Learning**: Each refactor closes with a documented commit and a forward-looking test plan.

## Turn 26: Correcting Scope (Lines 2753-2764)
- **User** reminded Copilot that the immediate goal is code-to-code ripples rather than doc drift.
- **Copilot** acknowledged and reframed T034’s target to code-only dependency graph propagation, including planned tests and fixtures.
- **Artifacts**: planning note.
- **Learning**: Keep the implementation roadmap aligned with the freshly updated spec priorities.

## Turn 27: Revalidate Spec Alignment (Lines 2765-2778)
- **User** asked for a spec alignment double-check before diving in.
- **Copilot** reread spec/plan/tasks, confirmed US1 remains code impact, and reiterated that T034–T038 should now proceed sequentially.
- **Artifacts**: alignment confirmation.
- **Learning**: Regular spec crosswalks prevent drift between roadmap and implementation.

## Turn 28: Build Code Ripple Foundations (Lines 2779-2904)
- **User** granted high-agency approval to proceed.
- **Copilot** created `tests/integration/us1/codeImpact.test.ts`, added `feature.ts` and `util.ts` fixtures, introduced `diagnosticUtils.ts`, `buildCodeGraph.ts`, and `saveCodeChange.ts`, and began wiring `publishCodeDiagnostics.ts`, cleaning lint ordering along the way.
- **Artifacts**: codeImpact.test.ts, new fixtures, buildCodeGraph.ts, saveCodeChange.ts, diagnosticUtils.ts, publishCodeDiagnostics.ts skeleton.
- **Learning**: Seeding fixtures and integration tests first anchors the behavior before pipeline wiring.

## Turn 29: Autosummary Context Check (Lines 2905-2908)
- **User** supplied the last 1000 lines to counter any autosummarization loss and asked if the plan changed.
- **Copilot** confirmed the roadmap stood unchanged: finish wiring code ripple diagnostics and rerun tests.
- **Artifacts**: none.
- **Learning**: When context cleans, a quick affirmation prevents accidental scope shifts.

## Turn 30: Wire Pipeline + Debug Graph (Lines 2909-3040)
- **User** encouraged continued execution.
- **Copilot** linked the new publisher into change flows, ran lint/integration repeatedly, probed the SQLite graph via ad-hoc Node scripts, and added `features/utils/uri.ts` plus canonicalization updates across watcher/persistence/diagnostics to eliminate duplicate URIs.
- **Artifacts**: publishCodeDiagnostics wired, saveCodeChange integration, uri.ts helper, fixture recalibrations, numerous diagnostic scripts (later removed).
- **Learning**: Canonical URIs are essential to avoid fragmenting graph nodes across watcher and persistence layers.

## Turn 31: Fixture Cleanup Praise (Lines 3041-3238)
- **User** applauded the temporary DB inspection script and confirmed its deletion.
- **Copilot** continued refactoring, reran lint/unit/integration, adjusted tasks.md, reset fixtures (core.ts/feature.ts/util.ts, architecture.md), and ensured `.link-aware-diagnostics` was regenerated cleanly.
- **Artifacts**: updated fixtures, tasks.md ticks (T034, T036, T037, T038), cleaned architecture.md, regenerated integration outputs.
- **Learning**: Maintaining deterministic fixtures keeps integration diagnostics meaningful across repeated runs.

## Turn 32: Finalize Code Ripple Pipeline (Lines 3239-3395)
- **User** responded to the iteration prompt, authorizing continued work.
- **Copilot** performed final lint/unit/integration cycles, deleted stale `.link-aware-diagnostics` directories, captured updated architecture.md content, and summarized the completed pipeline with next steps (T035 + targeted unit tests).
- **Artifacts**: final uri normalizations, saveDocumentChange.ts adjustments, integration reruns, closing summary.
- **Learning**: The code-to-code diagnostic pipeline now flows end-to-end, paving the way for symbol ingestion and richer graph queries.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **Spec Realignment**: Specs and tasks were reauthored to prioritize code-to-code ripple detection before documentation drift.
- **Automation Discipline**: Onboarding prompts, native rebuilds, and fixture resets were automated so unit/integration suites run unattended.
- **Graph Integrity**: URI canonicalization, dependency graph construction, and hysteresis gating combined to produce stable diagnostics.
- **Testing Cadence**: `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`, and `npm run test:integration` were rerun at every major milestone to validate behavior.
- **Documentation Habit**: Daily summaries, rebuild notes, and SpecKit updates ensure provenance and ramp-up clarity.

## Next Phase
- Implement **T035** to ingest VS Code symbols so real AST relationships enrich the dependency graph.
- Add focused unit coverage for `buildCodeGraph` and `publishCodeDiagnostics` to complement the integration suite.
- Explore leveraging the local Gemma 3:27B provider within the inference bridge to keep diagnostic generation fully local during tests.
