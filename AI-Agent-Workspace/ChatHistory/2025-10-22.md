jfjordanfarr: Hello! Today is 10/22/2025 and it a new dev day. Whenever we start a new dev day, we begin by summarizing the previous dev day into an auditable, line-range-referenced, turn-by-turn summary doc, which can later be used as a compressed reference for user intent and the trajectory of development/the overall vision. Once you've completed that, we'll talk about next concrete development steps. This exercise is performed to keep development aligned and contextualized across many sessions. (Today is dev day six!)

Please summarize #file:2025-10-21.md  into #file:2025-10-21.SUMMARIZED.md following the style of the other #file:Summarized chats.

Now let me create the comprehensive summary: 

Created [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-21.SUMMARIZED.md)

Perfect! I've created the comprehensive Dev Day 5 summary for 2025-10-21.md. The summary follows the established format with:

- Turn-by-turn breakdown with line references
- Commit correlations  
- Cross-cutting themes
- Salient decisions ratified
- Next phase guidance

Key highlights from Dev Day 5:
- MDMD documentation crystallization (both top-down and bottom-up)
- Falsifiability pass with new integration test suites
- Complete acknowledgement service implementation (T042/T043)
- Diagnostics tree view (T044)
- Node 22 harmonization to match VS Code
- User intent census capturing all stakeholder guidance
- "Safe to commit" automation

The summary preserves the ~10:1 compression ratio (4585 lines → ~420 lines) and maintains full auditability with line ranges and commit hashes.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: I think that the commit history in the summary is a little off, but it's a very good start.

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the commit correlations section to accurately reflect all the commits from Oct 21: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've updated the commit correlations to accurately reflect all 9 commits from Oct 21, mapping each one to its corresponding conversation turns. The summary now properly traces the development progression from the early T041 commit through the final documentation updates.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Great! So development history looks like so! (I do this to push a reasonable census of the development history into the chat log for today so that we can always have its learnings handy).

# 2025-10-16 Conversation Summary
_(Full source in `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025-10-16.md`. Compression ratio ~10:1 (3749 source lines → ~375 summary lines).)_

---

## Turn 1: Initial Vision & API Strategy (Lines 1–159)

**User Request**: How to build a system raising IntelliSense problems when docs and code that reference each other diverge? Interested in two paths: (1) markdown layers ↔ implementation files; (2) cross-file code references based on AST.

**Copilot Response**: Searched VS Code APIs for diagnostics, file watchers, and dependency tracking. Proposed treating docs/code as nodes in a dependency graph, using `workspace.createFileSystemWatcher`, `languages.createDiagnosticCollection`, and registering `DiagnosticRelatedInformation` to show cross-file links. Suggested encoding relationships via metadata or heuristic discovery; offered a prototype sketch using `validatePair` to compare hashes/semantic data and emit diagnostics conditionally.

**Learnings**: User's 4-layer markdown model (vision → requirements → architecture → implementation) requires explicit graph structure. Language Server Protocol was identified as the appropriate backbone for scaling beyond VS Code.

---

## Turn 2: LSP vs. Extension Trade-off (Lines 160–248)

**User Request**: Determine whether to build an LSP backend or a pure VS Code extension, noting Copilot's weakness in extension development when new windows raise (context is lost).

**Copilot Response**: Compared both approaches. **VS Code Extension**: fast prototyping, offline, simpler debugging, but can block the extension host under heavy work and harder to reuse outside VS Code. **Language Server (LSP)**: keeps analysis in a separate process, avoids UI blocking, reusable across editors, but adds multi-component distribution complexity. **Recommendation**: Opt for LSP now to validate long-term architecture and work around Copilot's extension context limitations.

**Learnings**: User's choice to pursue LSP was strategic—it permits reuse and sidesteps the IDE context-window problem.

---

## Turn 3: Polyglot AST & Parser Tiers (Lines 249–345)

**User Request**: Given that Copilot must be polyglot-aware, how can we handle languages without perfect AST support? Mention LLM-derived ASTs, but keep lightweight. Recommend a graph DB approach.

**Copilot Response**: Described a **Tier 0/1/2 parser strategy**: top-tier languages use Tree-sitter/mature parsers; others fall back to rule-based enrichment; exotic stacks get LLM extraction with confidence scores. Recommended **SQLite property graphs** (proven by SCIP/LSIF) for simplicity and portability; suggested KùzuDB only if richer query patterns emerge. Introduced the idea that an LLM with a 32k token window could walk the graph on-demand, deciding impact ripples. Proposed caching embeddings and allowing LLM-driven "expand node X" tool calls to keep context tractable.

**Learnings**: Confidence scoring and provenance tracking (parser vs. LLM) are essential; graph storage can stay lightweight if nodes always carry accurate spans.

---

## Turn 4: Riding Official VS Code APIs (Lines 346–420)

**User Request**: What can VS Code APIs provide so we don't reinvent wheel? How do we consume improvements as they arrive?

**Copilot Response**: Detailed native VS Code leverage points: (1) `languages.onDidChangeDiagnostics` + `languages.getDiagnostics()` let you subscribe to other servers' output without re-parsing. (2) `commands.executeCommand('vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider', uri)` and related `execute*Provider` commands proxy to active language servers for symbols, definitions, references, and call graphs. (3) `workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument`, `createFileSystemWatcher`, and semantic tokens APIs expose file events and language-server semantic data. Endorsed LSIF/SCIP index consumption for offline seeding. Stressed modular LSP design so third-party server improvements flow automatically into the graph via the ingestion layer.

**Learnings**: **Core insight**: piggyback on continuously improving language servers rather than compete with them. Keep the ingestion layer modular so graph benefits from upstream updates automatically.

---

## Turn 5: LLM Access Strategy & vscode.lm (Lines 346–420 continued)

**User Request**: Research best approach to access LLM for the LSP. Does VS Code expose settings for local Ollama? Should we assume a running instance?

**Copilot Response**: Announced that VS Code 1.91+ exposes `vscode.lm.requestChat` and `vscode.lm.selectChatModels`, abstracting away whether models are remote (Azure OpenAI, Copilot) or local (Ollama, LM Studio). Noted `machine.learning` settings namespace with Ollama defaults (`localhost:11434`). Proposed keeping the language server agnostic by having the **client** (VS Code extension) handle `vscode.lm` calls, while the LSP backend defines custom requests. Optional adapters: Ollama REST or OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Stressed that avoiding Ollama lock-in means riding improvements as VS Code adds new providers.

**Learnings**: Delegate LLM calls to the client, respect user consent/auth, cache responses with provenance, and stay provider-agnostic to benefit from future platform evolution.

---

## Turn 6: Consent, Cost, and Background Usage (Lines 346–420 continued)

**User Request**: Elaborate on cost implications, background chat sessions, and liabilities when requesting LLM responses on behalf of users.

**Copilot Response**: Clarified that `vscode.lm` calls consume user's Copilot quota/credits exactly as manual chat would. Documented required governance: (1) gate feature behind settings (default off or prompt), (2) label cloud vs. local model usage, (3) surface usage telemetry to users. Discussed "Bring Your Own Key" providers and need for explicit consent before sending proprietary code. Noted legal/compliance requirements: GitHub Copilot Terms demand user consent; enterprise policies may forbid cloud model access. Recommended `local-only` mode as default for sensitive workspaces and persistent logging of every cloud LLM call for audit.

**Learnings**: Background LLM usage carries real cost and legal burden; transparency and consent are non-negotiable.

---

## Turn 7: Specification, Planning & Requirements (Lines 68–707)

**User Request**: Run `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, and `/speckit.analyze` to scaffold the feature spec and task breakdown.

**Copilot Response**: Executed SpecKit workflow: (1) Created `spec.md` documenting user stories (doc↔code sync, code dependency monitoring), functional/non-functional requirements, edge cases, success criteria, and assumptions. (2) Generated `plan.md` with phases (setup, foundations, user stories 1–3, hardening) and key deliverables. (3) Authored `tasks.md` with 38–47 sequential tasks across setup, maintenance, overrides, diagnostics, acknowledgements, and testing. Ran `/speckit.analyze` to identify gaps: missing settings toggles (FR-010), ricochet loop handling, delete/rename recovery, change batching, and performance instrumentation. Created `checklists/requirements.md` and `checklists/inference.md` for QA gates. All artifacts reference spec assumptions (inference-first, workspace-index regeneration, external schema contracts).

**Learnings**: Formal spec + planning discipline caught missing requirements (ricochet, settings, edge cases) before implementation; checklists serve as pre-implementation gates.

---

## Turn 8: Hysteresis, Ricochet, and Edge Cases (Lines 420–707)

**User Request**: How do we prevent doc→code→doc ricochet diagnostics? What about deletes and renames? Debouncing for multi-file Copilot edits?

**Copilot Response**: Proposed **hysteresis rule**: when artifact A triggers alert on B, further alerts from B→A are paused until acknowledgement or new edits post-acknowledgement. Documented file delete/rename recovery: auto-removal of links with UI prompts to rebind or prune. Specified change batching: debounce window (default 1s) buffers rapid edits before rebroadcasting diagnostics, respecting user's quiet-feedback expectations. Added requirements FR-011 (hysteresis), FR-012 (debounce), FR-013 (link repair). Expanded `tasks.md` with T033 (hysteresis controller), T020–T021 (file maintenance), T022–T023 (change queue and settings bridge).

**Learnings**: Ricochet suppression via acknowledgement state is essential; debounce + noise filters prevent churn and honour fast-feedback goal.

---

## Turn 9: Provider Selection Gate & Consent Clarity (Lines 737–842)

**User Request**: Clarify LLM provider selection logic. Should diagnostics be blocked until user chooses?

**Copilot Response**: Ran `/speckit.clarify`. Offered three options: A (default local-only, opt-in for cloud), B (auto mode respecting VS Code defaults), C (force provider selection on first run, block diagnostics until chosen). **User chose C**. Updated spec, plan, and tasks to enforce disabled diagnostics until explicit provider pick, with onboarding flow surfacing LLM options and consent warnings. Recorded the decision in spec clarifications log.

**Learnings**: Explicit provider selection enforces responsible AI governance and aligns with constitution principle (user autonomy over LLM usage).

---

## Turn 10: Inference-First Link Discovery (Lines 1000–1141)

**User Request**: Instead of front-matter metadata for links, adopt a VS Code workspace-index paradigm: auto-infer relationships from language servers, make the graph rebuildable like VS Code's own caches, and allow optional overrides.

**Copilot Response**: Reworked spec, plan, research, and tasks to describe link inference as primary (via `execute*Provider` and heuristics), overrides as exceptional. Updated FR-001: system infers links from language-server data and optional overrides; no mandatory front matter. Documented assumption: link graph is a disposable projection, rebuilt on-demand from workspace signals, just like VS Code's own indexes. Plan Phase 2 now covers link-inference orchestrator, incremental sync, and external feed ingestion. Updated quickstart to walk users through the inference flow, explaining that rebuilds happen automatically and cache deletion is safe.

**Learnings**: Inference-first + rebuildable-cache model decouples the system from manual annotation, mirrors VS Code's own infrastructure, and enables graceful degradation when external feeds are unavailable.

---

## Turn 11: Knowledge-Graph Schema & External Feeds (Lines 1320–1520)

**User Request**: Clarify how external knowledge-graph feeds (e.g., GitLab GKG) integrate. What schema/contract must they satisfy?

**Copilot Response**: Added FR-014 (knowledge-graph-backed monitoring) and FR-015 (external schema enforcement). Defined minimal contract: artifact id, edge type, direction, timestamp, confidence. Specified ingestion modes: (a) one-off snapshot imports, (b) long-lived subscription feeds. Documented failure scenarios: unreachable feeds fall back to local inference; stale/partial feeds trigger diagnostic warnings. Updated `knowledgeGraphBridge.ts` to normalise snapshots, handle streaming updates, and track checkpoints. Ensured overrides precedence rule (manual overrides > inferred > external feeds) is consistent everywhere.

**Learnings**: External feeds are additive optimizers; local inference remains the reliable baseline. Schema contracts and failure handling prevent cascading outages.

---

## Turn 12: AST-Backed Accuracy Testing (Lines 1600–1800)

**User Request**: We can verify our software's outputs against ground-truth ASTs of known codebases (e.g., C programs). Add this as a development-time validation mechanism, distinct from reproducibility checks.

**Copilot Response**: Added FR-016 (validate knowledge graph against ground-truth ASTs when available, fall back to self-similarity benchmarks otherwise). Extended spec edge cases: distinguish repos with canonical ASTs (C, curated samples) from those without (use self-similarity). Updated plan Phase 6 to introduce AST testbed with language coverage expectations and CI integration. Added tasks T060–T062: curate AST fixtures, implement comparison harness, wire both modes into CI. Positioned AST validation as a development-time QA tool (not runtime), enabling reproducibility audits and confidence-level tracking.

**Learnings**: Dual-mode benchmarking (AST comparison + self-similarity) lets us verify correctness against ground truth where available and measure stability where it's not.

---

## Turn 13: Implementation Bootstrap (Lines 2000–2523)

**User Request**: Execute `/speckit.implement`. Generate scaffolding: npm workspaces, TypeScript config, base package.json, extension and server stubs.

**Copilot Response**: Created workspace structure: root `package.json` with npm workspaces, `tsconfig.base.json`, ESLint flat config, debug/task profiles. Generated `packages/extension`, `packages/server`, `packages/shared` with initial `.ts` files. Scaffolded domain models (`Artifact`, `Link`, `ChangeEvent`), GraphStore SQLite interface, maintenance contracts, and override workflows. Wired extension.ts with command handlers and settings sync. Routed server main.ts through connection setup, document sync, and notification handlers. Implemented: (a) T020–T021: orphan cleanup + rebind prompts on delete/rename; (b) T022: change queue with debounce timer; (c) T023: settings bridge syncing config to runtime; (d) T024–T025: knowledge-graph ingestion contracts.

**Learnings**: Early scaffolding establishes clean module boundaries; tasks T020–T025 lock down maintenance plumbing before diagnostics logic lands.

---

## Turn 14: Lint, Type Safety & Runtime Fixes (Lines 2523–3586)

**User Request**: Resolve npm install issues (workspace: URL protocol), pin Node 20 for prebuilt binaries, fix ESLint and TypeScript errors.

**Copilot Response**: (1) Pinned Node.js 20.x in `package.json` and created `.nvmrc` to dodge `better-sqlite3` native compilation. (2) Migrated ESLint from legacy `.eslintrc.cjs` to modern flat config (`eslint.config.js`) with `typescript-eslint` type-aware rules. (3) Added `vscode-languageserver-textdocument` dependency. (4) Fixed 19 lint errors: corrected import groups, added UUID resilience, marked promises as `void` or awaited, narrowed `unknown` types, and removed unused bindings. Ran `npm run lint` successfully.

**Learnings**: Type-aware linting catches real issues (unsafe member access, floating promises) early; pinning portable Node LTS avoids CI/contributor toolchain friction.

---

## Turn 15: Copilot Instructions & Constitution Update (Lines 3300–3620)

**User Request**: Refresh `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `constitution.md` to capture "always true" workspace facts and development principles.

**Copilot Response**: Updated `copilot-instructions.md` to document: workspace shape (npm workspaces, supporting directories), primary tooling (VS Code Extension API, SQLite, vscode.lm), build commands. Added reminders: development is synchronous (you + Copilot only), chat history lives in `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/`, use terminal to navigate gitignored directories when needed. Refreshed `constitution.md` with principles: (1) documentation unity (keep docs ↔ code aligned), (2) leverage official tooling, (3) responsible AI (consent before cloud calls), (4) fast feedback, (5) simplicity/stewardship. Noted that no external contributors or asynchronous git activity are in scope for now.

**Learnings**: Always-in-context instructions remind Copilot of foundational assumptions; constitution keeps high-level values explicit across all implementation work.

---

## Cross-Cutting Themes

- **Ride Existing Wins**: Prefer `execute*Provider` APIs over parsers; consume language-server diagnostics; mirror VS Code's cache-invalidation model.
- **Consent & Transparency**: No cloud LLM calls until user picks provider; surface cost/model info prominently.
- **Reproducibility**: Graph is deterministic (accurate spans, confidence scores), benchmarks (AST + self-similarity) validate correctness.
- **Modular, Type-Safe Code**: Early infrastructure (queue, settings bridge, maintenance) unblocks feature work; lint enforcement catches bugs.

---

## Salient Decisions Ratified
1. **LSP backend** over extension—avoids context-window loss, enables reuse.
2. **Inference-first** links (no front matter)—aligns with VS Code workspace indexing.
3. **Explicit provider selection** gate—enforces responsible AI, respects user autonomy.
4. **Dual-mode accuracy** (AST + self-similarity)—enables verification against ground truth where possible.
5. **Node 20** LTS—prebuilt binaries, portable across dev/CI.

## Commit Correlations
- **6bccf94** (2025-10-16 22:46 -0400) — `first run of spec-kit; implementation up to T027`; maps to Turns 07–14 where SpecKit artifacts were generated, clarified (via `/speckit.*` commands), and the initial implementation scaffolding plus lint/type fixes landed.
---

## Next Phase
Continue `/speckit.implement` with User Stories 1–3: link inference orchestrator (T026), markdown watcher (T029), diagnostic publishing (T027), acknowledgement service (T036), and integration tests (T030–T035).

# 2025-10-17 Conversation Summary
_(Full source in `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025-10-17.md`. Compression ratio ~10:1 (1641 source lines -> ~165 summary lines).)_

---

## Turn 1: Summary Mandate (Lines 1-78)
- **User** requested a detailed 10/16 recap with turn-by-turn line references and instruction reminders about synchronous development and on-disk chat history.
- **Copilot** reread `2025-10-16.md` plus its prior summary, drafted an initial condensed retrospective, and flagged the two instruction tweaks for `copilot-instructions.md`.
- **Artifacts** touched: `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-16.SUMMARIZED.md` (new draft), plus instruction TODOs.
- **Learning**: Daily summaries must operate as discoverable provenance indexes, not just blurbs.

## Turn 2: Enforce Turn Numbering (Lines 79-108)
- **User** insisted on a ~10:1 compression ratio with numbered turns tied to source line spans and triggered the automation toggle.
- **Copilot** rebuilt the 10/16 summary into a 375-line, 15-turn table with explicit line ranges, intent, response, and learning call-outs.
- **Artifacts** updated: `2025-10-16.SUMMARIZED.md` now tracks every turn; automation hook acknowledged.
- **Learning**: Future summaries must default to line-linked, per-turn structure without needing reminders.

## Turn 3: Fact-Check LSP Decision (Lines 109-123)
- **User** challenged the summary by asking for proof that the LSP backend choice was actually ratified.
- **Copilot** traced the 10/16 log (lines 160-185) to confirm the user’s explicit “pursue the LSP path” reply and affirmed the summary’s accuracy.
- **Artifacts**: none new; evidence cited directly from the log.
- **Learning**: Always cite original line numbers when asserting key architectural decisions.

## Turn 4: Map All Salient Decisions (Lines 124-139)
- **User** pressed for corroboration of each decision listed in the summary.
- **Copilot** mapped five outcomes (LSP backend, inference-first links, provider gate, dual accuracy checks, Node 20 pin) back to their originating line ranges in `2025-10-16.md`.
- **Artifacts**: trust in the summary reinforced without edits.
- **Learning**: Maintain a crosswalk between summary claims and their source lines to support future audits.

## Turn 5: Assess SpecKit Progress (Lines 140-163)
- **User** accepted the summary and asked for a workspace-vs-plan gap analysis.
- **Copilot** reviewed `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/tasks.md`, shared code folders, and confirmed T001-T025 were intact while T054-T056 and all US1-US3 tasks remained open.
- **Artifacts**: none yet; analysis informed the roadmap.
- **Learning**: Regular plan-to-workspace audits keep SpecKit truthy before tackling new stories.

## Turn 6: Resume speckit.implement (Lines 164-286)
- **User** directed Copilot to resume `/speckit.implement` from T026 onward, honoring the prompt script.
- **Copilot** ran the SpecKit prerequisite checks, reread checklists, then implemented the fallback inference pipeline (`packages/shared/src/inference/fallbackInference.ts` plus tests), created `specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/knowledge-schema.md`, and added the server `schemaValidator.ts`.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`, `npm run lint`.
- **Learning**: The fallback path now normalizes artifacts, merges LLM hints, and emits deterministic IDs, satisfying T054-T056 prerequisites.

## Turn 7: Fix Vitest Coverage Conflict (Lines 287-375)
- **User** flagged an unexpected Vitest auto-install failure (“???”) after the first test run.
- **Copilot** inspected `package.json`, pinned `@vitest/coverage-v8@1.6.1` to match `vitest@1.6.x`, ran `npm install`, and re-ran `npm run test:unit` successfully while noting the engine mismatch warning.
- **Artifacts**: root `package.json` updated with the coverage dependency.
- **Learning**: Guarding devDependencies against Vitest’s on-demand installers prevents task prompts from interrupting CI runs.

## Turn 8: Normalize Node Version Policy (Lines 376-391)
- **User** explained Node 20 could not be installed alongside Node 22 on the current machine and pointed out the “it’s just us” reality.
- **Copilot** relaxed the root `package.json` engine entry to `>=20.x`, removing the warning while keeping LTS parity guidance.
- **Artifacts**: `package.json` engines field widened.
- **Learning**: Tooling warnings should align with the active developer environment without breaking the official recommendation.

## Turn 9: Repair LLM Fixture Test (Lines 392-454)
- **User** supplied the failing `fallbackInference` test output showing no links were produced.
- **Copilot** discovered the markdown fixture text was shorter than the `minContentLengthForLLM` threshold, lengthened it, and re-ran `npm run test:unit` to green.
- **Artifacts**: `fallbackInference.test.ts` fixture text expanded.
- **Learning**: Test fixtures must satisfy guardrails (content length) to exercise the intended LLM pathway.

## Turn 10: Plan Next Steps via SpecKit (Lines 455-514)
- **User** asked what to tackle next while staying aligned with spec docs.
- **Copilot** confirmed T054-T056 were now satisfied, selected US1 tasks, and wrote the acceptance-first integration test `tests/integration/us1/markdownDrift.test.ts` plus fixtures under `tests/integration/fixtures/simple-workspace/`.
- **Tooling**: added `@types/mocha`, ran `npm run lint`.
- **Learning**: Locking the integration target early clarifies requirements for the remaining US1 implementation.

## Turn 11: Build Link Inference Orchestrator (Lines 515-657)
- **User** instructed Copilot to execute T028.
- **Copilot** created `packages/shared/src/inference/linkInference.ts` to unify fallback heuristics, workspace provider data, and external feeds, re-exported it via `packages/shared/src/index.ts`, and added unit coverage (`linkInference.test.ts`).
- **Tests**: `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`.
- **Learning**: Centralizing provenance and deduping logic enables consistent downstream consumption.

## Turn 12: Stand Up Markdown Watcher (Lines 658-824)
- **User** asked Copilot to keep going, implying T029.
- **Copilot** analyzed plan specs, added `packages/server/src/features/watchers/markdownWatcher.ts`, expanded the change queue for async batches, exposed `graphStore.listArtifacts()`, and scaffolded unit tests; a tool prompt asked whether to continue iterating.
- **Tests**: `npm run lint`, `npm run test:unit`.
- **Learning**: The server now streams markdown saves through the inference orchestrator while capturing seeds and hints.

## Turn 13: Confirm Watcher Completion (Lines 825-869)
- **User** explicitly authorized the pending “Continue to iterate?” action.
- **Copilot** finalized the watcher tests, reran `npm run test:unit`, and summarized the new pipeline plus upcoming needs (persisting change events and publishing diagnostics).
- **Artifacts**: watcher suite stabilized, vitest aliases adjusted.
- **Learning**: Debounced markdown processing is ready for persistence layers.

## Turn 14: Implement Persistence and Diagnostics (Lines 870-1064)
- **User** directed Copilot to complete T030 and T031 and keep SpecKit docs current.
- **Copilot** delivered `saveDocumentChange.ts`, `publishDocDiagnostics.ts`, their tests, updated `main.ts`, `changeQueue.ts`, and `tasks.md`, and ran `npm run test:unit` plus `npm run build`; SpecKit statuses for T026, T028-T031, and T054-T056 were checked off.
- **Artifacts** also included doc updates that mirror the new pipeline.
- **Learning**: Diagnostics now flow from markdown saves through inference, persistence, and publication.

## Turn 15: Wire Problems Provider (Lines 1065-1231)
- **User** noted a fresh commit to main (third overall) and asked for T032 plus future diagnostic strategy planning.
- **Copilot** authored `packages/extension/src/diagnostics/docDiagnosticProvider.ts`, registered the new quick-fix command in `extension.ts` and `package.json`, marked T032 complete in `tasks.md`, and ran `npm run lint` (exposing generated `dist` noise); an errant tool dump temporarily bloated the provider file for later cleanup.
- **Artifacts** staged for commit: extension activation wiring, command metadata, and updated task list.
- **Learning**: The VS Code Problems view now offers an “open linked artifact” quick action once the file cleanup is addressed.

## Turn 16: Clean Provider Artifact (Lines 1232-1249)
- **User** manually purged the 59 KB tool-call dump that landed in `docDiagnosticProvider.ts`.
- **Copilot** re-verified the file, corrected indentation around `normaliseUri`, and confirmed the implementation was intact.
- **Artifacts**: provider file stabilized without stray payloads.
- **Learning**: Manual hygiene checks remain essential whenever tool output exceeds size guardrails.

## Turn 17: Outline Post-T032 Priorities (Lines 1250-1264)
- **User** revisited the earlier request to discuss what follows T032.
- **Copilot** recommended focusing on T033 hysteresis control, diagnostic snapshot persistence in SQLite, broader integration benchmarks, and rerunning lint/tests once those land.
- **Artifacts**: strategic outline only.
- **Learning**: Planning next waves keeps SpecKit, diagnostics history, and testing in sync.

## Turn 18: Stage Commit Content (Lines 1265-1309)
- **User** asked Copilot to prepare a commit before switching machines.
- **Copilot** staged the updated chat log, extension command wiring, provider file, and `tasks.md`, reviewed diffs, and suggested `git commit -m "Add doc drift quick fixes to the extension"`; `npm run lint` still failed because generated `dist` files were in scope.
- **Artifacts**: staging area snapshot shared for the user’s git workflow.
- **Learning**: Documenting staged changes plus command suggestions speeds handoffs across devices.

## Turn 19: Silence Lint Noise (Lines 1310-1641)
- **User** pointed out that lint churn now comes from compiled `dist` assets.
- **Copilot** updated `eslint.config.js` to ignore `**/dist/**` and `**/out/**`, reran `npm run lint` successfully, and noted the change could join the pending commit if desired.
- **Artifacts**: lint config hardened; staging left to user discretion.
- **Learning**: Central lint configs must exclude generated bundles to keep CI actionable.

## Commit Correlations
- **3cf24be (2025-10-17 22:21 -0400, "Up to T031 and T054/T056 complete")**: Captures the work from Turns 6-14, including fallback inference scaffolding, the markdown watcher, change persistence, diagnostics publisher, and SpecKit task updates.
- **3ab7556 (2025-10-17 23:18 -0400, "Up to T032 complete")**: Aligns with Turns 15-19, adding the VS Code Problems provider, command wiring, task progress, and the lint-ignore refinement.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **SpecKit Fidelity**: Every tranche of code changes updated `tasks.md`, `plan.md`, and supporting docs so the plan stayed authoritative.
- **Inference Pipeline Maturation**: Fallback heuristics, orchestrator logic, and the markdown watcher formed an end-to-end path from docs to diagnostics.
- **Tooling Hygiene**: Addressed Vitest dependency prompts, Node engine mismatches, lint scope, and fixture constraints to keep commands deterministic.
- **Testing Discipline**: Repeated `npm run test:unit`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` runs validated each layer before moving forward.
- **Human Oversight Loop**: The user’s audits (summary fact-checks, file cleanup) ensured outputs remained trustworthy and traceable.

## Salient Decisions Ratified
1. Resume feature work only after SpecKit artifacts confirm scope (Turns 5-6).
2. Treat integration tests (T026) as the north star before implementing US1 internals (Turn 10).
3. Accept Node >=20.x to match the current runtime while retaining LTS guidance (Turn 8).
4. Next milestones prioritize hysteresis control and diagnostic snapshotting before expanding benchmarks (Turn 17).

## Next Phase
- Implement T033 hysteresis controller and lay down diagnostic snapshot storage in SQLite to unlock acknowledgement flows.
- Finish wiring the US1 integration test via the VS Code runner and start assembling larger real-world workspaces for benchmarking.
- Package the staged changes (including `eslint.config.js`) into the prepared commit once final verification is done.

- **Artifacts**: AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/Summarized/2025-10-17.SUMMARIZED.md.
- **Learning**: Daily handoff docs must stay auditable so subsequent threads can fast-forward directly into implementation.

## Turn 02: Hysteresis Marching Orders (Lines 46-238)
- **User** praised the recap and effectively issued `/speckit.implement` for T033, insisting on spec hydration before coding.
- **Copilot** ingested spec/plan/tasks, authored `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/hysteresisController.ts`, wired acknowledgement APIs into `publishDocDiagnostics.ts`, added vitest coverage, and ran `npm run lint` plus `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: hysteresisController.ts, hysteresisController.test.ts, updated publishDocDiagnostics*, changeQueue/saveDocumentChange adjustments.
- **Learning**: Reciprocal markdown diagnostics now respect a suppression window, unlocking end-to-end hysteresis validation.

## Turn 03: Suggest Running Integrations (Lines 239-499)
- **User** requested an integration pass to exercise hysteresis.
- **Copilot** reran lint/unit suites, reported all six unit tests green, surfaced coverage deltas, and highlighted the need to rebuild the VS Code harness before hysteresis can be validated end-to-end.
- **Artifacts**: none new; executions confined to `npm run lint` and `npm run test:unit`.
- **Learning**: With hysteresis in place, the next risk lies in end-to-end wiring rather than unit coverage.

## Turn 04: Integration Harness Fails to Launch (Lines 500-602)
- **User** shared PowerShell logs showing `npm run test:integration` failing because `tests/integration/vscode/runTests.js` was missing and pressed for dogfooding.
- **Copilot** audited the integration folder, converted the runner to TypeScript (`runTests.ts`), added `tests/integration/vscode/tsconfig.json`, removed the `tsx` dependency, and ensured the command now builds the harness before invocation.
- **Artifacts**: tests/integration/vscode/tsconfig.json, rewritten runTests.ts, package.json dependency cleanup.
- **Learning**: The integration harness must self-compile to avoid stale JS artifacts when dogfooding via VS Code.

## Turn 05: QuickPick Breaks Automation (Lines 603-808)

- **Copilot** threaded `RippleAnalyzer` through `changeProcessor`, updated diagnostics publishers to consume precomputed ripple impacts, expanded runtime settings and provider guard to include ripple controls, refreshed tests, and confirmed all gates.
- **Artifacts**: packages/server/src/runtime/changeProcessor.ts, features/diagnostics/{publishDocDiagnostics.ts,publishCodeDiagnostics.ts,rippleTypes.ts}, rippleAnalyzer*.ts updates, providerGuard/settings adjustments, test rewrites.
- **Learning**: Ripple hints now carry depth/path/confidence into diagnostics, moving T041 from concept to working pipeline.

## Turn 12: Seed Ripple Data with Path Reference Detection (Lines 3653-4186)
- **User** highlighted low-effort knowledge graph seeding via path detection and reiterated committing chat logs.
- **Copilot** authored `pathReferenceDetector` with tests, plugged it into `artifactWatcher` to seed relationship hints from literal file paths, reran tests/build, and aligned unit coverage.
- **Artifacts**: packages/server/src/features/watchers/pathReferenceDetector*.ts/.test.ts, artifactWatcher.ts updates, fixture tweaks.
- **Learning**: Regex-based file reference discovery now auto-infers relationships from docs/code, enriching ripple analysis without LLM cost.

## Turn 13: Commit Readiness + Next Steps (Lines 4187-4634)
- **User** asked if T041 warranted another commit and noted desire to continue; also reiterated chat history inclusion policy.
- **Copilot** reviewed spec tasks, confirmed T041 near completion but pending client surfacing/integration tests, and recommended committing after packaging the current diff (still pending at day’s end).
- **Artifacts**: None new; planning only.
- **Learning**: Remaining T041 work centers on client UX and integration falsifiability, with Option A still steering the roadmap.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **Knowledge Graph Maturity**: Blueprint + implementation now cover ingestion, checkpoints, diagnostics gateway, and runtime wiring for external feeds.
- **Runtime Maintainability**: main.ts was decomposed into focused runtime modules, aligning with new guidelines on file size and clarity.
- **Ripple Intelligence**: Analyzer outputs now inform diagnostics with depth/path/confidence while heuristic path detection seeds the graph automatically.
- **Testing Discipline**: Every major feature landed with dedicated unit suites and repeated lint/test/build runs, maintaining trust in rapid iteration.
- **Traceability Culture**: Daily summaries, MDMD docs, and commit correlations reinforced the lab-notebook ethos valued by the user.

## Next Phase
- Surface ripple metadata inside the VS Code client (diagnostic hover, detail panels) and update tasks.md to close T041 formally.
- Expand integration tests to validate symbol + knowledge feed cooperation and ripple diagnostics end-to-end.
- Continue enriching knowledge feed sources (additional static descriptors, future workspace searches) to broaden the graph.
- Plan the follow-on spec items (e.g., T042+) once ripple UX and falsifiability gaps are addressed.

- **Artifacts**: Spec status updated, fixtures stabilized, acknowledgement test skeleton.
- **Learning**: Keeping spec metadata current and fixtures clean maintains reproducibility.

## Turn 19: Fix Integration Test Fixture Pollution (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** requested fixing the test suite to avoid slow `git checkout` tool calls after every integration run.
- **Copilot** reworked `runTests.ts` to copy `simple-workspace` into a temporary directory (`fs.promises.cp` + `mkdtemp`) before launching VS Code, ensuring integration runs never dirty the repo; verified with `npm run test:integration` (15 passing, 2 pending).
- **Artifacts**: Updated runTests.ts; fixtures now stay clean.
- **Learning**: Copying fixtures into temp dirs eliminates repo churn and speeds up agentic iteration.

## Turn 20: Implement T043 Acknowledgement Service (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** greenlighted T043 (acknowledgement service).
- **Copilot** added acknowledgement persistence to `graphStore.ts` (artifact lookups, diagnostic retrieval, status updates), created `acknowledgementService.ts` with audit logging + hysteresis release, wired it into `main.ts`, added unit coverage (`acknowledgementService.test.ts`), threaded acknowledgement state through `changeProcessor.ts`, persisted diagnostic history with `change_event_id`, implemented emission guards in `publishDocDiagnostics.ts` and `publishCodeDiagnostics.ts`, and exposed `linkDiagnostics.acknowledgeDiagnostic` LSP contract.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: Acknowledgement service, persistence layer, LSP contract, updated publishers.
- **Learning**: Acknowledgement state now survives restarts and blocks repeat emissions until fresh change events.

## Turn 21: Extension Acknowledgement Command (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **Copilot** created `packages/extension/src/commands/acknowledgeDiagnostic.ts`, added "Acknowledge diagnostic" quick fix in `docDiagnosticProvider.ts`, plumbed record/target/trigger metadata through `LinkDiagnosticData` parsing, and centralized the command identifier to avoid string drift.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`.
- **Learning**: Quick fix actions in the Problems panel now trigger acknowledgement directly from diagnostics with record IDs.

## Turn 22: Integration Test for Acknowledgement Flow (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** requested integration tests to prove acknowledgement end-to-end.
- **Copilot** unskipped `acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts`, added end-to-end scenario (trigger doc ripple → acknowledge → verify diagnostic disappears → fresh change emits new record ID), hardened test harness with `clearDiagnostics`, `appendText`, and diagnostic polling utilities, tightened server unit tests for TypeScript safety.
- **Tests**: `npm run build`, `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`.
- **Learning**: US3 integration suite now catches acknowledgement flow regressions.

## Turn 23: T042/T043 Commit (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** confirmed readiness to commit T042/T043.
- **Copilot** checked off T042/T043 in `tasks.md`, staged changes, committed with chat history as "feat: implement acknowledgement service (T043) and integration test (T042)".
- **Artifacts**: Committed acknowledgement service + tests.
- **Learning**: Each task completion includes chat history for audit trail and future understanding.

## Turn 24: Option Weighing for Next Priority (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** requested comparing several options for next development steps based on spec, MDMD docs, and user-intent census.
- **Copilot** proposed: (1) finish US3 surfaces (T044/T045 tree view + export), (2) ship noise filter tuning (T046), (3) kick off knowledge-feed enrichment (T05x), or (4) instrument telemetry (T059), recommending **Option 1** to close FR-004/FR-005 triage UX before expanding scope.
- **User** approved Option 1.
- **Learning**: Explicit option weighing aligns development with roadmap priorities and MDMD architecture.

## Turn 25: Implement T044 Diagnostics Tree View (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **Copilot** added `DiagnosticsTreeDataProvider` in `diagnosticsTree.ts`, registered tree-specific acknowledge/refresh commands, exposed Explorer view contributions in `package.json`, created `listOutstandingDiagnostics.ts` server handler with unit coverage, hooked `linkDiagnostics/diagnostics/list` LSP request into `main.ts`.
- **Tests**: `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: Diagnostics tree view, server support for listing diagnostics.
- **Learning**: Tree view surfaces active diagnostics with artifact metadata; acknowledge actions clear entries as expected.

## Turn 26: Node 22 Harmonization (Lines 4101–4585 continued)
- **User** reported extension activation failure due to `better-sqlite3` ABI mismatch (Node 127 vs. Electron 136), asked to bump Node version to 22 to match VS Code.
- **Copilot** raised toolchain baseline to Node 22 by updating `.nvmrc`, `engines.node`, lockfile metadata, and project docs; created `rebuild-better-sqlite3.mjs` helper to fetch prebuilt binaries for current Node runtime, falling back to source build if needed.
- **Tests**: `npm run build`, `npm run test:integration`, `npm run test:unit`.
- **Artifacts**: Node 22 alignment, native rebuild automation, committed as "feat: add diagnostics tree view and node 22 harmonization".

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- **MDMD Crystallization**: Bidirectional documentation sweep (top-down vision + bottom-up implementation briefs) revealed structural gaps and solidified traceability from user intent → code.
- **Falsifiability Discipline**: Integration test expansion (markdown link drift, scope collisions, transform ripple) plus "safe to commit" automation strengthened regression detection before expanding scope.
- **Acknowledgement Workflow**: End-to-end implementation (persistence, LSP contract, extension command, tree view, integration tests) closed FR-004/FR-005, enabling lead triage workflows.
- **Node 22 Harmonization**: Aligning Node runtime with VS Code's Electron ABI eliminated native module friction and simplified contributor onboarding.
- **Continuous Auditability**: Daily summaries, user intent census, chat history commits, and MDMD link hubs maintained provenance and reproducibility across sessions.

## Salient Decisions Ratified
1. **Falsifiability First** (Option B): formalize commit-readiness automation and expand integration coverage before adding new features.
2. **MDMD as Design Tool**: use layered markdown docs to plan tests, capture architecture, and audit consistency before implementation.
3. **Node 22 Baseline**: harmonize with VS Code's runtime to eliminate ABI thrash and simplify native dependency management.
4. **Acknowledgement Service**: persist diagnostic state with change-event linkage so acknowledgements survive restarts and suppress repeat emissions until fresh edits.
5. **Tree View Surfaces** (Option 1): prioritize lead triage UX (T044/T045) to close FR-004/FR-005 before expanding knowledge feeds or telemetry.

## Next Phase
- Complete T045 (export diagnostics command) to finish US3 surface requirements.
- Validate the diagnostics tree view renders active diagnostics and acknowledge actions clear entries in live extension testing.
- Expand US3 integration coverage once export command lands.
- Consider noise filter tuning (T046) or knowledge-feed enrichment (T05x) based on operational feedback from the tree view.

Perfect! I'm now fully hydrated on the current state. Let me provide my perspective on next steps:

---

## Current State Assessment

**Completed (Dev Day 5 end):**
- ✅ T041: Ripple analyzer with path reference detection
- ✅ T042/T043: Acknowledgement service + integration tests
- ✅ T044: Diagnostics tree view (implemented but has lint issues)
- ✅ Node 22 harmonization
- ✅ MDMD crystallization (full Layer 1→4 traceability)
- ✅ Falsifiability suites (US3-US5 integration tests)
- ✅ User intent census
- ✅ "Safe to commit" automation

**Immediate Blockers:**
- 🔴 15 lint errors preventing clean commits
- 🟡 T044 not marked complete in tasks.md
- 🟡 T045 (export diagnostics) remains unimplemented

**Dev Day 6 Status:**
- Fresh session with full development history hydrated
- Clean slate for implementation after fixing lint issues

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### **Option A: Housekeeping + T045 (Export Diagnostics)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Rationale**: The diagnostics tree view (T044) is functionally complete but has minor quality issues. Fixing lint errors and completing T045 would close out the entire US3 surface requirements (FR-004/FR-005), delivering the full lead triage workflow before expanding scope.

**Sequence:**
1. Fix 15 lint errors (import ordering, unused vars, type safety)
2. Mark T044 complete in tasks.md
3. Implement T045 export diagnostics command with CSV/JSON output
4. Add unit tests for export command
5. Update integration tests to validate export flow
6. Commit: "feat: complete US3 triage surfaces (T044/T045)"

**Estimated scope**: ~2-3 hours of focused work, delivers complete US3.

---

### **Option B: Knowledge Feed Enrichment (T05x)**

**Rationale**: With US1 (code impact) and US3 (acknowledgement) solidified, expanding knowledge graph ingestion would enrich ripple detection beyond local workspace signals. This aligns with Layer-2 roadmap "T05x – Knowledge Graph Enrichment".

**Sequence:**
1. Fix lint errors first (prerequisite)
2. Design/document LSIF or SCIP feed ingestion contracts
3. Extend `knowledgeGraphIngestor` to consume structured dumps
4. Add provenance metadata to diagnostics (inferred vs. imported edges)
5. Integration test with sample LSIF fixture

**Estimated scope**: ~1 day, higher architectural impact.

---

### **Option C: Noise Filter Tuning (T046)**

**Rationale**: Operational feedback from the tree view might reveal diagnostics churn. Implementing configurable noise suppression (confidence thresholds, artifact type filters) would improve signal-to-noise before broader rollout.

**Sequence:**
1. Fix lint errors first
2. Extend settings schema with filter controls
3. Implement `noiseFilter.ts` applying thresholds at publication time
4. Add unit tests for filter logic
5. Update integration tests to validate filtering

**Estimated scope**: ~4-6 hours, incremental UX polish.

---

## My Recommendation

**Pursue Option A** for the following reasons:

1. **Completionist mindset**: US3 is 95% done; closing T045 delivers the full "lead triage" promise cleanly.
2. **Quality baseline**: Addressing lint errors now prevents them from compounding as new code lands.
3. **Momentum preservation**: T045 is a natural continuation of T044 tree view work while context is fresh.
4. **Audit trail**: Committing a complete US3 provides a clean checkpoint before expanding to knowledge feeds or noise tuning.
5. **Falsifiability**: Export command enables testing that acknowledgement state persists across restarts (potential US3 integration test enhancement).

## Concrete Execution Plan (Option A)

1. **Fix lint errors** (~15 mins):
   - Reorder imports (8 violations)
   - Mark floating promise as `void` (1 violation)
   - Fix diagnosticsTree.ts type safety (unused var, redundant union, unsafe return)
   - Remove unnecessary type assertion in `graphStore.ts`

2. **Implement T045 export command** (~1-1.5 hours):
   - Create `packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts`
   - Add LSP request `linkDiagnostics/diagnostics/export` in shared contracts
   - Implement server handler using `listOutstandingDiagnostics` + formatting
   - Register command in package.json + wire in `extension.ts`
   - Support both CSV and JSON formats via quick pick

3. **Add tests** (~30-45 mins):
   - Unit test for export command with mock diagnostics
   - Update acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts to validate export flow

4. **Documentation + commit**:
   - Mark T044/T045 complete in tasks.md
   - Update Layer-4 docs if needed
   - Commit with chat history

**Do you want me to proceed with Option A, or would you prefer Option B/C? I'm ready to execute autonomously once you greenlight the direction.**

jfjordanfarr: Option A! You're clear to proceed. :)

GitHub Copilot: Perfect! I'll execute Option A autonomously: fix lint errors, implement T045 export diagnostics, add tests, and commit. Let me start by fixing the lint issues. 

Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"


```

```

```

```
Let me read those files to get the exact formatting:

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#180-180), lines 180 to 195

Now I can fix the remaining issues more precisely:

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#350-350), lines 350 to 359

Searched text for `mockStore.getArtifact` (`**/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts`), no results

The unbound method test failures were already in the test file but not shown in the original lint output section I read. Let me check the actual line numbers from the lint error: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#182-182), lines 182 to 192

Good - that test file is already using the correct pattern. Now let me verify the lint status and continue: 

Ran terminal command: npm run lint

Some replacements didn't take. Let me check what happened and fix the remaining issues more carefully: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/extension.ts#1-1), lines 1 to 26

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#1-1), lines 1 to 11

I see - the extension.ts file has different function names. Let me read more and fix all remaining issues: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/extension.ts#140-140), lines 140 to 190

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#180-180), lines 180 to 200

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#348-348), lines 348 to 359

Searched text for `getArtifact:` (`**/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts`), no results

The test lint errors are in a different section. Let me search for those lines: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#175-175), lines 175 to 195

Searched text for `hysteresis.shouldSuppressDiagnostic` (`**/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts`), no results

The test file looks fine actually. Let me just run eslint --fix to auto-fix what's possible, then handle the rest manually: 

Ran terminal command: npx eslint . --fix

Good! Down to 8 errors from 15. Now let me fix the remaining ones: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#175-175), lines 175 to 195

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#343-343), lines 343 to 359

Searched text for `hysteresis.shouldSuppressDiagnostic,` (`**/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts`), no results

Let me search around line 187: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#182-182), lines 182 to 192

Line 187 is `expect(acknowledgements.registerEmission).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);`. The "unbound method" error means we need to look at where `acknowledgements` is created. Let me find that: 

Searched text for `createAckServiceStub` (`**/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts`), 3 results

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#98-98), lines 98 to 118

Now I see - the stub returns a mock object. The lint error is saying that when we use `acknowledgements.registerEmission` directly (not calling it), we're passing an unbound method. Let me check how it's used: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/publishDocDiagnostics.test.ts#98-98), lines 98 to 128

I see - the stub is returning the methods directly. The lint warning is about the `expect` calls that reference methods without calling them. This is actually fine in vitest - those are being passed to `toHaveBeenCalledTimes`. The lint error is overly strict here. Let me disable that specific rule for those lines:

Ran terminal command: npm run lint

Great progress! Down to 3 errors. Let me look at those remaining issues:

Ran terminal command: npm run lint

One more! Let me look at line 283: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts#278-278), lines 278 to 286

The issue is that `composite.dispose()` returns void but the signature might be mismatched. Let me check the interface: 

Searched text for `export interface DiagnosticsTreeRegistration` (`**/diagnosticsTree.ts`), 1 result

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/views/diagnosticsTree.ts#245-245), lines 245 to 255

The interface extends `vscode.Disposable`, which has `dispose(): any`. The issue is the return type of the arrow function. Let me wrap it properly:

Ran terminal command: npm run lint

Perfect! All lint errors resolved. Now let me implement T045 export diagnostics command. First, let me create the shared contract: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/shared/src/contracts/diagnostics.ts)

Created [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.ts)

Good! Now let me wire it into the extension and package.json: 

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/extension.ts#12-12), lines 12 to 42

Read [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/extension.ts#135-135), lines 135 to 150

Now let me create a unit test for the export command: 

Created [](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/packages/extension/src/commands/exportDiagnostics.test.ts)

Now let me run the tests and build to ensure everything works: 

Ran terminal command: npm run lint

Ran terminal command: npm run build

Let me fix the test lint issues:
