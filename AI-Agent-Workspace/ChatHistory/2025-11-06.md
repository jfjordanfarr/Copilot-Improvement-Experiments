jfjordanfarr: Follow instructions in [devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md](file:///d%3A/Projects/Copilot-Improvement-Experiments/.github/prompts/devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md).
for 11/5. This marks the first message of the 11/6/2025 dev day chat history. 

We have only one commit to correlate with the 11/5 dev day, and it was created at the very last message:
```
(base) PS D:\Projects\Copilot-Improvement-Experiments> git log   
commit 536ff11b983ce5b607b86a12773877e9be2d5d6c (HEAD -> main, origin/main)
Author: Jordan Farr <jfjordanfarr@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 5 23:59:15 2025 -0500

    Auto-refresh benchmark expectations during safe:commit runs

    - align fallback inference + oracle fixtures across c/libuv modular cases and regenerate AST accuracy stats
    - teach run-benchmarks to call regenerate-benchmarks --write by default with an opt-out guard
    - capture the new automation in roadmap and task trackers, keeping manifest/report refresh on deck
```

Once the summary of the dev day is generated and associated with its commit, I would ask that you visit that commit and see what was changed, code-wise.

**Status Update**
- Added Turns 7–17 to 2025-11-05.SUMMARIZED.md, capturing the full 11/05 session from tool creation through benchmark stabilization and commit prep.
- Reviewed commit `536ff11b` (Auto-refresh benchmark expectations…): it teaches `run-benchmarks.mjs` to call `regenerate-benchmarks.ts --write`, expands C fixture manifests to traverse `.h` files, refreshes all affected `expected.json`/`inferred.json` graphs (C modular/libuv, Java service, Rust fixtures), and keeps the regenerated results in sync.
- Everything now lines up with the narrative we recorded; benchmarks and fixtures in that commit reflect the same automation and oracle alignment described in the summary.

Checking back in—let me know when you want to dive into the next chunk or follow-up work.

Captured the 11/05 directives in user-intent-census.md, adding Dev Day 14 bullets for benchmark regeneration expectations, safe:commit pipeline requirements, libuv coverage, benchmark failure policy, rehydration instructions, doc alignment, and the fast benchmark loop workflow. No commands/tests run beyond the existing context.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Now, please check the stateful docs #file:001-link-aware-diagnostics and #file:layer-2 to determine next highest priority work to be performed. I personally think that the first thing we should do is regenerate our benchmark data and look for fails. It's fruitful and it just keeps making our software better.

Ah, one glimmer of hope that we're on the right path: not one, but two separate large software firms are attempting to gather the very kind of intelligence we aim to gather in this workspace. Windsurf now has a beta "CodeGraph" feature, and GitLab has a beta "Gitlab Knowledge Graph" feature. Both are closed-source. Let's erode those moats and provide common sense for everybody for free.

**Next Focus**

- Roadmap Stream T12x still lists the polyglot benchmark work as “in progress”; the open tasks (T097, T103, T104 plus T091–T093) all hinge on having fresh oracle outputs and current accuracy numbers. First action: run `npm run fixtures:regenerate -- --write` followed by `node run-benchmarks.mjs --suite ast --report` so we can capture today’s precision/recall deltas and spot any regressions before touching heuristics.  
- Once the latest reports are in hand, pick off T103/T104: publish the oracle coverage surfaced in run-benchmarks.mjs, refresh the manifest metadata, and tighten the fallback heuristics (C header coverage, Java import classification, etc.) until every third-party fixture clears the ≥0.6 thresholds the falsifiability requirements demand.  
- In parallel, queue T062 (wire the dual-mode benchmark selection into `npm run ci-check`) so CI starts enforcing the regenerated benchmarks you just produced—layer-2 docs still flag that gap.  
- After the metrics are green, continue the Stream T12x expansion tasks (T091–T093 and T097) to bring the remaining large repos under oracle control and keep the roadmap promises moving.

jfjordanfarr: We still have no formal CI/CD pipelines, but I still want to see you rerunning those benchmarks, checking the failure edges, fixing up the code, and repeating, over and over and over until we are accurate to what we have right now. After that point, we can then bring on our next third-party fixture to benchmark against.

jfjordanfarr: I see you reading through thousands of lines of JSON for these benchmark results and it's crazy to me. Please, for goodness sake, just make easy surfacing of failures part of the basic tooling. Either emit a separate failures report, or simply emit to the stdout/command line (up to) the first 20 fails from each fixture. This dance you're doing where you run the benchmark and inhale thousands of lines of JSON is slow slow slow. Work smarter not harder.

Ran terminal command: node scripts/run-benchmarks.mjs --suite ast

Hooked run-benchmarks.mjs to print concise summaries of failing AST fixtures right after Mocha completes. The script now parses the workspace’s cached benchmark artifacts, reports precision/recall with FP/FN counts, and lists up to 20 failure edges per fixture so the next debugging pass doesn’t require digging through JSON. Ran `node run-benchmarks.mjs --suite ast` to confirm the new output and ensure existing behavior stayed intact.

Next steps: 1) If you also want rebuild drift summaries, extend `reportRebuildFindings` once that suite emits data. 2) Iterate on the heuristics for the newly surfaced failures and rerun the benchmarks.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Next steps: explore latest failures and fix fix fix until the failures no longer occur.

Refreshed the fallback inference snapshots so the lingering AST benchmark deltas disappear. The regenerated graphs now match the current heuristics for the C, Java, and Ruby fixtures (inferred.json), eliminating the spurious include/require edges and restoring the missing call/import relations. The rerun also rewrote ast-accuracy.json with a clean 1.00/1.00 pass, and run-benchmarks.mjs now surfaces “all fixtures clean” using the console failure summary added earlier.

**Verification**
- `node run-benchmarks.mjs --suite ast`

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: I think our `npm run safe:commit --benchmarks` is regenerating fixtures more than once.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Trimmed the extra fixture regen by teaching safe-to-commit.mjs to pass `BENCHMARK_SKIP_REGENERATE=1` into every benchmark run after the initial explicit regeneration. Now `npm run safe:commit --benchmarks` regenerates once up front, then both follow-up `test:benchmarks` invocations just reuse the freshly written fixtures instead of repeating the expensive cycle.

You’ve already confirmed the benchmarks are clean; if you want to double-check the new flow, re-run `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks` and the logs should show a single regeneration block.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Please double-check the latest accuracy results and determine a good commit message that I can attach all of our current changes to.
