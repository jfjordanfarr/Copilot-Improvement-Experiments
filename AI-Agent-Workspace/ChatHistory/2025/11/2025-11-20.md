jfjordanfarr: Follow instructions in [devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md](file:///d%3A/Projects/Live-Documentation/.github/prompts/devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md).
for the 11/19 dev day. Interestingly, there is a new source of changes arriving. I've been having Gemini 3 work on visuals for the project. Last night, it created a `live-docs:visualize` CLI tool and it's rather phenomenal. Still early days, but I want to make sure that you're aware of where changes are coming from. Gemini excels at visuals, so I used the Antigravity IDE for visualization work, while I will continue to use VS Code/Copilot for standard code work, ensuring each plays to their strenghts. Here are the commits to correlate from yesterday's overall work:
```

Folded the three Gemini Antigravity chats into 2025-11-19.SUMMARIZED.md, outlining how each session (pre, concurrent, post) influenced the 11/19 dev day and linking the visualization work to commit `23bf777b797ad9d7191ac612b32c7e601120b63c`. Let me know if you’d like deeper detail on any of those sessions or if we should surface similar callouts for earlier dates.

jfjordanfarr: Now, can you please tell me if we have any permanent test fixtures for which  no piece of Live Documentation exists?

Only five permanent fixtures currently lack mirrored Live Documentation:

- helpers.h
- Default.aspx
- Web.config
- template-pipeline.json
- web.config

Everything else under the benchmark and integration fixture trees already has a layer-4 companion. If you’d like, I can draft Live Docs for these five so we keep fixture coverage perfect.

jfjordanfarr: If we were to call a `npm run live-docs:generate`, would those docs be created? If not, why not?

**Coverage Insight**
- `npm run live-docs:generate` will not create new files for the five fixtures we flagged; they fall outside the current discovery patterns in liveDocumentationConfig.ts.

**Why They Are Skipped**
- helpers.h — headers (`*.h`) aren’t in `LIVE_DOCUMENTATION_DEFAULT_GLOBS`.
- Default.aspx — `.aspx` files aren’t covered by any default glob.
- Web.config and web.config — `.config` files are likewise excluded.
- template-pipeline.json — although `tests/**/*.json` is included, discovery in core.ts calls `glob()` with `dot:false`, so anything inside dot-prefix folders never surfaces.

**Next Options**
1. Extend the Live Docs config (or provide a targets.json manifest) so these extensions/paths are explicitly included.
2. Hand-author the layer-4 mirrors for the fixtures you want documented without changing generator scope.

jfjordanfarr: I... jeez, what do you think? I can understand maaaaaaaaybe skipping a header file (the "Stage0" Live Documentation is much akin to a C Header file), but the `Default.aspx` and `Web.config` are specifically here to test for a specific pattern. We put those in when we were creating `live-docs:inspect`. Do a search through the chat history for `Web.config` or `web.config` and see if you can find where we've talked about it in the past.

You already captured this in two earlier pushes:

- 2025-11-06.md records the WebForms benchmark you landed for `live-docs:inspect`: we authored the `Default.aspx`/`Web.config` fixture specifically “to capture the Web.config → Globals.cs → code-behind → .aspx → client JS chain the user asked for,” then noted that we wired manual edges so the inspect CLI can traverse Web.config and markup hops.  
- 2025-11-17.md shows the follow-up when we spun the generator directly against that fixture, passing `--include ... --include Web.config` to prove the CLI could surface the `Default.aspx` → `Web.config` relationship; the log even calls out “Wire analyzer edges so the generator records the Default.aspx → Web.config chain automatically (so the inspect CLI can traverse real data).”

So yes—those files were baked into the suite precisely to keep the inspect workflow honest, which is why letting Live Docs ignore them would undercut the test. Next step is deciding whether we expand the default globs or just pin manual doc mirrors for the WebForms assets.

jfjordanfarr: If I want this to work for me at my workplace, I need web.config files to get scooped up into our system. They matter a whole lot. There are so many questions the beguile devs on the daily about where certain values come from. Our inspect tool was designed to answer that question. Let us not leave it as dark matter to our Live Documentation system.

```
Expanded the default Live Documentation glob coverage so Web.config and related ASP.NET assets are discovered.

- liveDocumentationConfig.ts: added package/test patterns for `.config`, `.aspx`, `.ascx`, `.cshtml`, and `.razor` so discovery now includes Web.config alongside its markup companions.
- Live Docs generation will consume those files on the next run, letting the inspect workflow surface config-driven dependencies instead of treating them as dark matter.

Next steps:
1. Run `npm run live-docs:generate` (or the scoped CLI invocation you prefer) to materialize the new docs and verify the inspect hops update as expected.

GitHub Copilot: Live Docs generator picked up the new ASP.NET/Web.config coverage exactly as intended—four new docs landed for `visualize.ts`, both `Web.config` fixtures, and `Default.aspx`. Lint now flags them (plus the new CLI doc) for missing authored Purpose/Notes, so they’ll need quick narratives to quiet the warnings.

Next steps:
1. Author Purpose/Notes for visualize.ts.mdmd.md.
2. Do the same for Web.config.mdmd.md, Default.aspx.mdmd.md, and web.config.mdmd.md.
3. Re-run `npm run live-docs:lint` to confirm the warnings clear.

jfjordanfarr: Today I want to talk about **PowerShell**. At my day job, we have a TFS repo filled with an entire "Powershell Compendium" -- folder after folder of powershell scripts, some of which get used by others and provide references to them. What would it take to add fixtures and coverage for **PowerShell**?

GitHub Copilot: Love this—PowerShell deserves first-class treatment in the Live Docs world. Here’s what it would take to mirror a “PowerShell Compendium” the same way we currently do for TypeScript, C#, etc.

**Scope The Work**
- Add `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1` (maybe `.psd1`/`.psm1`) to the Stage‑0 discovery globs so Live Docs even consider these assets.
- Implement a PowerShell language adapter inside adapters. That adapter needs:
  - Export discovery (functions, classes, workflows) from script/modules.
  - Dependency listing for dot-sourced scripts (`. .\Utility.ps1`), `Import-Module`, `Using module`, `#requires` lines, and maybe external binary dependencies.
  - Optional docstring bridge reading comment-based help (`<# … #>`, `.SYNOPSIS`, `.PARAMETER`, etc.) into the Live Doc summary/remarks fields once docstring bridging turns on.

**Parsing Strategy**
- We’re in Node/TypeScript land; the PowerShell AST is only available via .NET. Easiest approach:
  1. Author a tiny helper script (`scripts/powershell/emit-ast.ps1`) that uses `[System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseFile(...)`.
  2. Serialize the AST (select the bits we care about) to JSON via `ConvertTo-Json`.
  3. The adapter runs `pwsh` (available on the dev box) to call that helper and reads the JSON payload.
- If we don’t want a pwsh runtime dependency, we could experiment with `@powerpipe/powershell-parser` (if viable), but pwsh is probably simpler: we already lean on platform tooling for benchmarks.
- We should write a small caching layer inside the adapter so repeated invocations don’t spawn pwsh every time (maybe reuse the CLI per run or share a temp AST file).

**Fixtures & Tests**
- Add an integration fixture under `tests/integration/fixtures/powershell-compendium/` that mimics three real patterns:
  1. Dot-sourced utilities with advanced functions (param blocks, comment-based help).
  2. Modules exporting functions and re-exporting from submodules (`Export-ModuleMember`).
  3. Scripts depending on config (`.psd1` data files) and referencing environment variables/JSON config.
- Document each fixture with Stage‑0 Live Docs (the new globs will generate them once the adapter exists).
- Expand the fallback inference heuristics (or create a dedicated PowerShell heuristic) so `live-docs:inspect` can follow edges like `Import-Module` ✓ `Get-Module` etc. That includes adding synthetic dependencies to the graph.
- Unit tests: We can add a new `powershell.adapter.test.ts` verifying export/dependency extraction using real fixture files; integration test ensures Live Docs generation doesn’t crash and the CLI pathfinder picks up dot-source chains.

**Pipeline Integration**
- Update `liveDocumentsConfig` default globs with `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1` once the adapter lands.
- Extend `npm run live-docs:generate` coverage and ensure `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks` picks up the new fixture/regeneration steps.
- Add AST benchmark coverage only if we have a public PowerShell repo to target (optional; maybe follow later with something like Pester or PowerShell-Get as an accuracy test).

**Docstring Bridge (Future)**
- Once the baseline adapter works, we can wire comment-based help into the docstring bridge: map `.SYNOPSIS` → summary, `.DESCRIPTION` → remarks, `.PARAMETER` entries to parameter table. That lines up with our schema from the docstring work already done in TypeScript/Python.

We can fast-follow with documentation (Layer‑3 System doc for “PowerShell analyzer”) and instructions updates. If you’re good with that outline, I can start with the adapter + fixtures in the next cycle.

jfjordanfarr: Sounds perfect! Let's build our way up to having docstring bridging on PowerShell by the end of the day! How many commits do you expect it to take as you build up to there? We usually issue 1-4 commits a day, and they're fairly chunky concurrent blocks of progress. 

GitHub Copilot: Let’s land PowerShell support in three substantial commits:

**Commit 1 – Baseline coverage**
- Add `.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1` to the default Live Docs globs.
- Create a `powershell-compendium` integration fixture (dot-sourcing, modules, data files).
- Scaffold a PowerShell adapter that shells out to `pwsh` to emit a trimmed AST JSON and records exports + dependencies.
- Simple unit test covering the adapter plus a Live Docs generation smoke run.

**Commit 2 – Graph + tooling integration**
- Extend fallback inference/inspect heuristics for `Import-Module`, dot-sourcing, and `#requires`.
- Wire the new fixtures into the `live-docs:inspect` tests and add CLI docs/Layer‑3 notes about PowerShell coverage.
- Ensure `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks` stays green with the new assets (regeneration hooks, lint updates).

**Commit 3 – Docstring bridge**
- Map comment-based help (`.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.PARAMETER`, etc.) into the Live Docs docstring schema.
- Add targeted fixtures/tests proving Synopsis→summary, Parameter→parameter table, etc.
- Update instructions/README to advertise PowerShell docstring support and rerun Live Docs lint to confirm narratives render correctly.

That keeps us within the 1–4 commits/day cadence, with each commit representing a coherent chunk of progress.

jfjordanfarr: 100% perfect! You are clear to proceed! Thank you so much for your continued work on this! I'm incredibly excited to see this functionality added!

**PowerShell Adapter**
- Hooked up the new PowerShell Live Docs adapter (powershell.ts) to shell out to emit-ast.ps1, normalize its JSON, surface exported functions, and capture dot-sourced/module dependencies with caching and dual-runtime (`pwsh`/`powershell`) fallback.
- Registered the adapter so it participates in analysis (index.ts).
- Expanded the default discovery globs to include `.ps1`, `.psm1`, and `.psd1` across packages, scripts, and tests (liveDocumentationConfig.ts).

No automated tests or generators were run yet; please run whatever validation you prefer (e.g. `npm test` or `npm run live-docs:generate`) when convenient.

Next steps you may want to queue up:
1. Add PowerShell fixtures and assertions so the adapter’s output is covered.
2. Run a Live Docs generation dry run to confirm the new globs pick up PowerShell sources.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Agreed wholeheartedly; please proceed with those next steps as you have described: #file:2025-11-20.md:534-536

Implemented the Stage-0 PowerShell pass end-to-end: powershell.ts now shells out to emit-ast.ps1, normalizes dot-sourced paths, and registers on the adapter roster. Added powershell.test.ts plus the `tests/integration/fixtures/powershell-compendium/**` suite so Vitest verifies symbol filtering, module imports, `#requires`, and dot-sourced edges. Brought emit-ast.ps1 up to Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatibility and JSON-stable output, then expanded the default Live Docs globs to cover `.ps1/.psm1/.psd1`. Regenerated Live Docs, authored the new Layer-4 narratives (including Gemini’s `visualize-*.ts` CLIs), and cleared lint.

Tests: `npx vitest run packages/shared/src/live-docs/adapters/powershell.test.ts`; `npm run live-docs:generate`; `npm run live-docs:lint`.

Next steps: 1) Extend graph/inspect heuristics so PowerShell dependencies feed the pathfinder (commit 2). 2) Layer in comment-based help bridging once the baseline lands (commit 3).

Made changes.
