## Turn 01: Rehydrate & Resume 11/12 Duties (Lines 1–160)
- **User**: “Follow instructions… for 11/12… only one commit to correlate,” pointing at `b2b8f7590d928fd356a0df008de17d3e6bfc51e3`.
- **Copilot**: Re-read the dev-history prompt plus every November summary, but accidentally reopened the prior workspace layout before the user reminded it to rehydrate on today’s log.
- **Outcome**: Ready to finish the outstanding 11/12 recap with the correct commit context.

## Turn 02: Complete 11/12 Summary & Census Updates (Lines 161–420)
- **Copilot**: Streamed the remaining 11/12 transcript, patched `2025-11-12.SUMMARIZED.md` through Turn 20, and refreshed both census files with new intent signals (polyglot fixture focus, docstring bridge plan, safe-commit expectations).
- **User**: Thanked the updates and requested next-step options grounded in the recent diffs and docs.

## Turn 03: Pick Next Fixture Language (Lines 421–620)
- **Copilot**: Reviewed the fresh diffs (`git show HEAD`) and proposed three options (Python, Java, Ruby/Rust) for the next docstring adapter.
- **User**: Ran `tree_gitignore.py --dirs-only`, highlighted the existing benchmark fixture layout, and chose “Java next… closest analogue to what we already have.”

## Turn 04: Scaffold Java Adapter & Fixtures (Lines 621–900)
- **Copilot**: Read the Java `basic` fixture sources, added `generation/adapters/java.ts`, registered it in `index.ts`, and expanded the fixture Javadoc to exercise summaries, params, returns, and links.
- **Tests/Builds**: `npm run build -w packages/server`.

## Turn 05: Extend Polyglot Integration Test (Lines 901–1,020)
- **Copilot**: Updated `polyglot-fixtures.test.ts` to cover the Java adapter output alongside the C# case, then ran `npm run test:integration` (initial failures prompted further adapter tweaks).

## Turn 06: Tighten Javadoc Parsing (Lines 1,021–1,160)
- **Copilot**: Iteratively refined the adapter—added `extractNearestJavaDoc`, limited which tags expect targets, and ensured member detection handles overloads—while the user reviewed fixture excerpts like `App.java` and `Catalog.java`.
- **Validation**: `npm run test:integration` now 30 passing / 1 pending.

## Turn 07: Safe-to-Commit Pipeline & Benchmark Snapshot (Lines 1,161–1,200)
- **Copilot**: Ran the full pipeline (`npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks`), capturing the AST accuracy report (e.g., Roslyn slice precision 0.988 / recall 0.854) and confirming all lint, docs, and fixture audits succeeded.
- **User**: Asked to surface generated Live Docs for manual audit before wrapping up the Java work.

_(Continuation: lines 1,201–2,276 parsed.)_

## Turn 08: Audit Generated Docs & Strip HTML (Lines 1,201–1,520)
- **Copilot**: Spun up `AI-Agent-Workspace/tmp/java-fixture-audit/` via `generateLiveDocs` so the user could inspect `App.java.mdmd.md` et al.
- **User**: Flagged the lone `<p>…</p>` snippet (“only one has this quirk”) and asked to keep Markdown native.
- **Copilot**: Updated the sanitizer to collapse block tags into paragraphs, regenerated audits, and proved the fix with fresh docs.

## Turn 09: Envision Richer Docstrings & Feature Flags (Lines 1,521–1,940)
- **User**: Pushed for less toy-like fixtures and sketched a “pseudocode-first authoring” dream (“the sky is the limit when you start from AST-valid pseudocode”).
- **Copilot**: Recommended a language-agnostic doc-comment AST, raw fragment preservation, canonical identifiers, and a feature toggle so richer parsing can be benchmarked or disabled if it hurts readability.

## Turn 10: Stage Java Adapter Commit (Lines 1,941–2,020)
- **Copilot**: Summarised the delta and proposed `feat(live-docs): add Java adapter and normalize Javadoc blocks`.
- **User**: “Awesome! That’s committed.”

## Turn 11: Document Bidirectional Authoring Vision (Lines 2,021–2,260)
- **User**: Asked for updates across Layer‑1/2/3 and the spec to capture Live Documentation as a generative surface.
- **Copilot**: Patched `link-aware-diagnostics-vision.mdmd.md`, `product-roadmap.mdmd.md`, `live-documentation-pipeline.mdmd.md`, and `spec.md`—introducing CAP‑006, REQ‑G1, COMP‑203, and story-level safeguards for two-way docstring edits.

## Turn 12: Broaden Authoring Roadmap & Blueprint the Workspace (Lines 2,141–2,200)
- **User**: Pressed for deeper planning (“There are more spec files you haven’t seen”).
- **Copilot**: Extended `plan.md` with a Stage 4 “Author” milestone and Phase 5 tasks, appended LD‑505→LD‑509 in `tasks.md`, introduced REQ‑F9 in `falsifiability-requirements.mdmd.md`, documented extension touchpoints, and drafted the “Workspace Cleanup & Layout Blueprint” outlining the rename workflow and future `docs/site/` scaffold.

## Turn 13: Fix Links, Archive Chat History & Stage Final Commit (Lines 2,201–2,276)
- **User**: Highlighted SlopCop failures (broken prompt links, missing `#comp203…` anchor) and reiterated the chat-history folder move.
- **Copilot**: Patched the prompt and Layer‑1 links to the new year/month structure, created `AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/README.md`, ensured roadmap anchors resolve, reran `npm run slopcop:markdown`/`npm run slopcop:symbols`, and—after a rehydrate—proposed the closing commit message `docs: capture authoring vision and archive chat logs by year/month`.
