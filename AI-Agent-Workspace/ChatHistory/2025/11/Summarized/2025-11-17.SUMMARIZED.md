## Turn 01: Kick Off 11/16 Recap (Lines 1–60)
- **User**: Ordered a dev-day summary for 11/16, listing commits `a3069ebe20532529ce33889413e9e0f4bffdefa4`, `93d4062863f449aa6746c7e416c1252f361827bd`, and `d2394c749bc0b83092b0e080de27330e42ccd9bd`, and noted the repetitive late-day authored-section grind.
- **Copilot**: Re-entered the dev-history workflow, reopening the ChatHistory index and the November summary files to prime the new write-up.

## Turn 02: Rebuild 11/16 Summary Foundations (Lines 61–240)
- **Copilot**: Read the 11/16 raw transcript in 1,200-line slices, created the new `2025-11-16.SUMMARIZED.md`, and documented the early turns covering headless harness extraction and doc regeneration.
- **Context**: Initial chunks focused on capturing the generator refactor, shared core split, and Live Docs pipeline wiring.

## Turn 03: Autosummarisation Recovery (Lines 241–320)
- **User**: Detected the agent exiting a lossy context window and demanded a rehydrate before continuing past line 2,400 of the raw log.
- **Copilot**: Re-read the dev-history prompt and reopened the current summary file to regain continuity before resuming extraction.

## Turn 04: Complete Mid-Log Coverage (Lines 321–420)
- **Copilot**: Parsed lines 2,761–5,160 of the 11/16 transcript, updating the summary with Turns 13–19 (AST benchmark recovery, instruction consolidation, re-export anchors, lint guardrails).
- **Notes**: Maintained the 1,200-line cadence and documented each regeneration/lint loop that restored Stage‑0 stability.

## Turn 05: Collapse the Authored-Section Marathon (Lines 421–500)
- **User**: Asked for a single aggregated block to cover the thousands of near-identical authored-section edits and insisted every referenced commit appear in the recap.
- **Copilot**: Planned to append a final umbrella turn plus annotate earlier entries with explicit commit correlations.

## Turn 06: Finalise 11/16 Summary (Lines 501–560)
- **Copilot**: Added Turn 20 describing the mass authored-section effort, tied Turns 15/18 to commits `a3069ebe20532529ce33889413e9e0f4bffdefa4` and `93d4062863f449aa6746c7e416c1252f361827bd`, and linked the closing block to `d2394c749bc0b83092b0e080de27330e42ccd9bd`.
- **Outcome**: 11/16 summary complete with all requested commit correlations.

## Turn 07: Diagnose Safe-Commit Failures (Lines 561–720)
- **User**: Explained that the prior commit landed before running `safe:commit` and pointed to `npm run slopcop:markdown` as the outstanding failure.
- **Copilot**: Authored `AI-Agent-Workspace/tmp/fixChatHistoryLinks.ts` to normalize ChatHistory paths, patched the handful of leftover `.mdmd` docs manually, and re-ran SlopCop until the markdown audit passed cleanly.

## Turn 08: Stage Post-Fix Commit (Lines 721–880)
- **User**: Shared the successful `safe:commit` run output and requested a commit message.
- **Copilot**: Proposed `docs: normalize ChatHistory links and refresh safe-commit outputs`, which the user immediately landed.

## Turn 09: Surface Next Work Options (Lines 881–960)
- **User**: Asked for the top three actionable items across Layer‑2 docs and the Stage‑0 spec kit.
- **Copilot**: Highlighted LD-208 (polyglot snapshots), LD-402 (inspect CLI), and LD-500+ (docstring drift detection) as the most impactful unfinished tasks.

## Turn 10: Validate Task Status (Lines 961–1,020)
- **User**: Queried whether LD-208 and LD-500 work was already complete and questioned the current state of any inspect tooling.
- **Copilot**: Confirmed LD-208 and the drift suite remain open, clarified that no `live-docs:inspect` CLI exists yet, and noted `npm run graph:inspect` merely fronts the existing graph helper.

## Turn 11: Initial LD-402 Plan (Lines 1,021–1,100)
- **User**: Chose LD-402, asking for a detailed plan.
- **Copilot**: Sketched a CLI that prints Live Doc sections (`--file/--doc`, optional `--json`), adds integration coverage, and updates documentation.

## Turn 12: Reframe Around Graph Pathfinding (Lines 1,101–1,200)
- **User**: Critiqued the plan as redundant, describing the “Oracle of Bacon” dependency-path vision and single-endpoint root tracing requirements.
- **Copilot**: Agreed to pivot the CLI to path finding (bidirectional hops, terminal fan-out, JSON output) and outlined next steps to implement the graph traversal focus.

---

## Turn 13: Inspect CLI Tests Fail (Lines 1,201–1,360)
- **System**: `npm run test:integration` progressed through the existing suites but failed the two new Live Docs inspect cases, flagging that the path finder returned exit code 1 for both the direct path and fan-out modes.
- **User**: Asked whether the Web.config fixture was disappearing into private graph territory, probing for blind spots in the new coverage.

## Turn 14: Manual Repro Attempts Go Sideways (Lines 1,361–1,520)
- **Copilot**: Dug into the failing test, read the fixture Live Docs, and attempted to reproduce the CLI locally via `node … --json` and Electron `Code - OSS.exe` launches, but PowerShell quoting mistakes created stray files instead of capturing output.
- **Observation**: Early runs confirmed the CLI wasn’t returning the expected path chain, but the manual probes were too noisy to isolate the issue yet.

## Turn 15: Reset & Clarify Execution Strategy (Lines 1,521–1,640)
- **User**: Questioned the odd commands and artefacts littering the workspace.
- **Copilot**: Explained the PowerShell missteps (`set` vs `$env`, quoting `Code.exe`), provided the correct `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` invocation, and recommended sticking with `node cli.mjs …` for quick checks.

## Turn 16: Diagnose Repo-Root Resolution (Lines 1,641–1,860)
- **User**: Directed the agent back to the core objective—get the inspect CLI tests passing.
- **Copilot**: Cleared the integration build artifacts, recompiled via `tsc`, instrumented `inspect-cli.test.ts` to walk up from `__dirname` until `package.json` is located (fixing the miscomputed repo root), and re-ran the integration suite.
- **Result**: `npm run test:integration` now exercises the CLI under Electron with the correct working directory.

## Turn 17: Confirm Fix & Fixture Visibility (Lines 1,861–2,000)
- **Copilot**: Reported green integration results, added richer failure messaging to the test harness, and summarised the original bug (launching tsx from the wrong folder). Answered the earlier fixture question by noting every hop (script → aspx → code-behind → Web.config) remains explicit in Live Docs, while cautioning that Razor/SPA/reflection seams may still need extra instrumentation.
- **Next Steps**: Suggested staging the changes and expanding fixtures for other boundary cases.

---

## Turn 18: Extend Heuristics & Fixtures (Lines 2,401–2,560)
- **Copilot**: Added a dedicated `aspnet` adapter plus DOM heuristics that sweep neighbouring markup, enriched C# adapter logic to follow configuration accessors and reflection lookups, and authored new Razor/SPA/reflection fixtures with matching Live Docs.
- **Tests**: Regenerated fixture docs and ran `npm run test:integration`, confirming the inspect CLI now navigates the new scenarios end-to-end.

## Turn 19: Lint Break & Quick Fix (Lines 2,561–2,620)
- **User**: Launched `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks --report`; ESLint failed on `import/order` within `adapters/index.ts`.
- **Copilot**: Reordered the adapter imports, re-linted the file, and instructed the user to resume the pipeline.

## Turn 20: Cover Live Doc Gaps (Lines 2,621–2,760)
- **User**: Safe-commit attempt exposed graph coverage misses for the new adapters, heuristics file, and fixtures.
- **Copilot**: Regenerated targeted Live Docs, refreshed Layer‑4 authored sections, resolved SlopCop symbol warnings, and reran `safe:commit` to completion (noting expected AST benchmark false negatives and pending authored-section TODOs).

## Turn 21: Pre-Commit Audit (Lines 2,761–2,824)
- **User**: Requested a final working-tree check and a commit message.
- **Copilot**: Reviewed diffs across code, fixtures, docs, and instructions; confirmed they match the inspect-pathfinder narrative; and proposed `feat: infer ASP.NET telemetry flows and expand inspect CLI coverage` for the checkpoint.
