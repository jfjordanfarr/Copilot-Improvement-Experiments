---

## Turn 01: Reopen the Dev-History Workflow (Lines 1–140)
- **User**: Welcomed the new dev day and asked to follow `devHistory.summarizeDay.prompt.md` for the 11/18 recap.
- **Copilot**: Re-read the prompt, ChatHistory index, and the most recent daily summaries to reestablish context before touching the raw transcript.

## Turn 02: Finish the 11/18 Summary After Autosummarisation (Lines 141–340)
- **User**: Flagged a lossy context reset, demanded completion of `2025-11-18.SUMMARIZED.md`, and listed the three commits to correlate (`3771cd8`, `46e1116`, `2eab0fe`).
- **Copilot**: Re-ingested the 11/18 log in 1,200-line blocks, updated the summary with Turns 01–25, and appended commit correlations covering the slug, Hangfire, and anchor-stabilisation work.

## Turn 03: Capture 11/18 Intent Signals (Lines 341–520)
- **User**: Requested new entries in `user-intent-census.md` based on the prior day’s chat.
- **Copilot**: Initially drifted into Live Doc anchor inspections, but after the user refocused the task, logged Dev Day 27 directives (LD‑402 scope, authored-section expectations, anti-reset guardrails) into the census.

## Turn 04: Review Gemini’s Antigravity Pass (Lines 521–780)
- **User**: Pointed to `tmp/antigravity/Enforcing MDMD Linking, Restoring Coverage.md` and asked what remained of Gemini 3’s documentation experiment.
- **Copilot**: Read the conversation, summarised the experimental rule enforcing Layer‑3 links for every Layer‑4 doc, and highlighted issues (system materialisations dumped into Layer‑3, only 2 % coverage, audits locked red).

## Turn 05: Decide on a Configurable Enforcement Strategy (Lines 781–920)
- **User**: Wanted the new requirement to be configurable or reversible, acknowledging the experiment’s exploratory nature.
- **Copilot**: Proposed keeping `layer4-orphans` as an opt-in profile, restoring rule defaults, hand-curating Layer‑3 docs, and tooling up targeted coverage reports; user approved the plan.

## Turn 06: Implement Opt-In Coverage Enforcement & Rewrite Layer‑3 Docs (Lines 921–1,200)
- **Copilot**: Updated relationship rule compilation to recognise profile modes, defaulted `layer4-orphans` to monitor/off, refreshed diagnostics reporting, and replaced Gemini’s bulk-generated Layer‑3 markdown with concise authored Purpose/Notes plus System References.
- **Outcome**: Summary of changes recorded; tests still pending (`npm run graph:audit` and `npm run safe:commit`).

## Turn 07: Link Layer‑4 Docs and Calibrate Audit Noise (Lines 1,201–1,420)
- **Copilot**: Authored missing Stage‑0 summaries for integration `tsconfig` mirrors and the US5 dry-run payload, wired Layer‑3 system docs to those Live Docs, and taught `audit-doc-coverage.ts` to ignore fixture mirrors that cannot link to code directly.
- **Outcome**: `npm run graph:audit -- --json` now reports only legacy Layer‑2/Layer‑3 gaps; benchmark telemetry and integration architecture docs cite concrete evidence.

## Turn 08: User Audit Snapshot Highlights Remaining Layer‑2/3 Debt (Lines 1,421–1,540)
- **User**: Ran `graph:audit`, `slopcop:markdown`, and `slopcop:symbols`, confirming 100% symbol coverage but noting five higher-layer docs without code links plus two broken markdown references.
- **Copilot**: Agreed to drive the audit back to zero before proposing a commit.

## Turn 09: Restore Graph Audit & Link Architecture Docs (Lines 1,541–1,720)
- **Copilot**: Repointed Layer‑3 architecture files to the regenerated Stage‑0 mirrors, removed stale link targets, and updated the audit engine so indirect Layer‑3→Layer‑4→code chains satisfy coverage.
- **Validation**: Reran `npm run slopcop:markdown` and `npm run graph:audit`; both returned clean reports with no remaining orphans.

## Turn 10: Stage Review & Commit Naming (Lines 1,721–1,860)
- **User**: Shared the wide-ranging `git status` and asked for a commit title summarising the audit and linkage work.
- **Copilot**: Proposed `tighten graph audit coverage and realign live-doc layer links` while acknowledging the large surface area touched.

## Turn 11: Triage Computer-Written Layer‑3 Docs & Authored Gaps (Lines 1,861–2,400)
- **User**: Flagged the newly generated Layer‑3 files as too machine-like and reminded that many Layer‑4 docs still lack authored Purpose/Notes, requesting another pass.
- **Copilot**: Began rereading every Layer‑3 Live Documentation file plus the affected fixtures, issuing batch edits to replace placeholder text, fill in authored sections, and prepare for `live-docs:lint` runs to eliminate outstanding warnings.

## Turn 12: Complete Fixture Authorship Pass (Lines 2,401–3,120)
- **Copilot**: Continued through the entire fixture corpus (Rust, Ruby, Python, C, C#, Java, benchmark manifests) to add succinct Purpose/Notes, regeneration guidance, and provenance links; responded to the user’s “Continue to iterate?” prompt mid-way to keep the sweep going.
- **Validation**: Ran `npm run live-docs:lint`; all warnings cleared, confirming the authored-section backlog is resolved.

## Turn 13: Safe-Commit Pipeline Runs Clean (Lines 3,121–3,600)
- **User**: Restarted Ollama, closed other apps, and reran `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks --report` to verify the widened changes under real conditions.
- **Copilot**: Observed lint, unit, integration, documentation-link enforcement, and benchmark regeneration all pass (aside from expected npm config warnings), leaving the workspace in a fully validated state with refreshed reports and fixtures.

## Turn 14: Extend Benchmark Headroom & Capture Roslyn Drift (Lines 3,601–3,760)
- **User**: Continued the safe-commit flow through the standalone benchmark suites; the AST run timed out while cloning the large Roslyn fixture, causing the pipeline to fail.
- **Copilot**: Raised the benchmark timeout in `astAccuracy.test.ts`, reran `npm run safe:commit -- --benchmarks --report`, and confirmed both self-similarity and AST suites now complete—reporting Roslyn precision 98.8 % / recall 85.3 % (3 FP, 43 FN) for follow-up analysis.

## Turn 15: Summarise Day’s Work for Commit Messaging (Lines 3,761–3,831)
- **User**: Accepted the benchmark drift for later investigation and requested a commit title reflecting the post–line 1,527 changes.
- **Copilot**: Reviewed the touched code/docs and proposed `Author benchmark Live Docs and surface symbol profile coverage` as the commit message candidate.

## Antigravity Session Summaries (Gemini Antigravity IDE)

### Pre-Dev-Day: Enforcing MDMD Linking, Restoring Coverage
- Gemini ran the full audit suite before the VS Code day began, turning on a hard `layer4-orphans` enforcement rule and bulk-promoting materialised system docs into Layer 3, which collapsed symbol coverage to 2 %.
- The session surfaced the scaling problem with mandatory Layer‑3 parents, produced an `audit.log` detailing hundreds of violations, and copied several system views into `.mdmd/layer-3/` for manual refinement later.
- These experiments triggered the VS Code plan (Turns 04–09) to demote the rule to opt-in, restore authored Layer‑3 narratives, and cleanly re-link the documentation graph.

### Concurrent: Incorporating Future Vision
- While the dev-day chat progressed, Gemini rewrote `README.md` using Layer 1–3 MDMD docs, the Link-Aware Diagnostics spec, and chat history tone studies to align the narrative with the user’s voice.
- The pass pulled in real CLI workflows (safe commit, graph audit, inspect, live-docs generate), contrasted Live Documentation with GitLab Knowledge Graph, Windsurf CodeMaps, and Google CodeWiki, and removed overstated claims after additional tone calibration.
- Resulting README edits emphasise local, regenerable documentation, highlight command examples validated in daily work, and hint at the “pie-in-the-sky” roadmap noted in November chats.

### Post-Dev-Day: Refining and Analyzing Graph
- After the VS Code session wrapped, Gemini ideated on graph exploration tooling, researched modern WebGL visualisers, and authored the new `npm run live-docs:visualize` CLI plus helper scripts for link/orphan analysis.
- Iterations added filtering to focus on Layer‑4 Live Docs, weighted edges by multi-reference intensity, and styled nodes by archetype with sizing driven by source line counts.
- The session closed by relocating temporary analysis scripts into `AI-Agent-Workspace/tmp/`, pruning transient JSON outputs, and preparing the `feat: live-docs:visualize` commit (`23bf777b797ad9d7191ac612b32c7e601120b63c`).
