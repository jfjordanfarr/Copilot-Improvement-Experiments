**Summary Ready**
- Added turn-by-turn coverage for 11/20 in 2025-11-20.SUMMARIZED.md, capturing the PowerShell adapter work, heuristic integration, and comment-help bridge through Turn 16.
- Folded both Antigravity chats (“Refining UI Interactions” and “Refining Interaction and Code Quality”) into a dedicated section outlining the visualization experiments, regressions, and UX feedback loops.
- Correlated the four requested commits: `c5678a94f1cb5ffe38f68609747f3ddbb25d679e`, `e3881cb807d86e2184bdd0c66101633950681762`, `732e6a987db5a71837a49b6a9b0899041f02f453`, and `c3f88409371dca40acbae26c46d3cff7c2357777`, pointing back to the relevant turns or Antigravity session.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Really well done! Wow! Can you now please update the user intent census md doc based on any new user intent signals you can derive from those 3 chats you just squashed together into that (really really good!) summary file?

**Update Logged**
- Captured the 11/20 PowerShell docstring-bridge mandate and visualization UX directives inside user-intent-census.md, citing both the dev-day log and Antigravity walkthrough for auditability.
- Documented expectations to consolidate the visualization tooling, lint-before-run discipline, and hands-on browser validation for all explorer views.

Next steps:
1. Reconcile current visualization implementation plans with the newly logged “single platform” and interaction evidence requirements.

Made changes.
