**Summary Ready**
- Added turn-by-turn coverage for 11/20 in 2025-11-20.SUMMARIZED.md, capturing the PowerShell adapter work, heuristic integration, and comment-help bridge through Turn 16.
- Folded both Antigravity chats (“Refining UI Interactions” and “Refining Interaction and Code Quality”) into a dedicated section outlining the visualization experiments, regressions, and UX feedback loops.
- Correlated the four requested commits: `c5678a94f1cb5ffe38f68609747f3ddbb25d679e`, `e3881cb807d86e2184bdd0c66101633950681762`, `732e6a987db5a71837a49b6a9b0899041f02f453`, and `c3f88409371dca40acbae26c46d3cff7c2357777`, pointing back to the relevant turns or Antigravity session.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Really well done! Wow! Can you now please update the user intent census md doc based on any new user intent signals you can derive from those 3 chats you just squashed together into that (really really good!) summary file?

**Update Logged**
- Captured the 11/20 PowerShell docstring-bridge mandate and visualization UX directives inside user-intent-census.md, citing both the dev-day log and Antigravity walkthrough for auditability.
- Documented expectations to consolidate the visualization tooling, lint-before-run discipline, and hands-on browser validation for all explorer views.

Next steps:
1. Reconcile current visualization implementation plans with the newly logged “single platform” and interaction evidence requirements.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Based on those antigravity conversations, can you please help concretize any of the requirements-like docs in #file:layer-2 , vision docs in #file:layer-1 , and spec docs in #file:001-link-aware-diagnostics to ensure that we're aligned on what the `npm run live-docs:visualize` visualization surface should actually do? I want to have a total of two visualization views for the workspace: the "circuit board" visualization (tree graph? I forget the name of it, but we don't have to call it "circuit board") which allows users to see inheritance relationships, click individual file names, and  explore the local neighborhood at the symbol level. The circuit board visualization should, on hover/click on any of its elements, expand that element to show its symbols and the outbound/inbound connections to them (plausibly via hiding all unrelated nodes, much like the current "Local View"). That is, the "circuit board" view and the "local view" should be integrated together, allowing the user to easily move in and out of local symbol-level detail and global file-level detail. In addition, that combined workspace view needs to eventually have text editing capabilities: if we want users to be able to author skeleton code bidirectionally (or alter a doc and hit a button to send to copilot to implement), we need to expect that users will be interacting with it textually. As such, a final requirement for that high-utility main merged view is WCAG AA Level accessibility compliance. Right now, it is nowhere near that. Gemini authored some frankly not-great code to do all this, but it got the groundwork laid and the prototype in the git history. Gemini left much for us to clean up, though. You'll want to raise those views in a little browser here to see what it looks like. I have added the Playwright MCP server to give you additional tooling to interact with your surroundings. Let me know if you prefer playwright to the "open simple browser" option (we can try either). If we don't want the playwright approach, I'll disable the tools to keep the context window clean (too many tools = bad LLM performance -- to much noise). Oh! The second visualization -- the force-directed graph! Okay, that visualization is honestly in better shape than the others, and because of its 3D exploratory nature, I'm okay if we don't hit WCAG AA compliance for that view. It's the main workhorse view that I'm converned with. Okay, with all of that out of the way, do you want to try and raise the `npm run live-docs:visualize` to see what it looks like for yourself?

**Docs Updated**
- Layer‑1 vision (link-aware-diagnostics-vision.mdmd.md) now recognizes CAP-008, articulates the unified visualization command center outcome, and logs a new success signal plus accessibility principle.
- Layer‑2 roadmap (product-roadmap.mdmd.md) adds REQ-V1 with workstreams, acceptance criteria, evidence, and traceability entries for the merged explorer.
- Spec kit files (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) now capture User Story 9, FR-LD16, SC-LD13, a visualization work item, Phase 4 deliverable, and the trio of LD-406/407/408 tasks aligned to accessibility + telemetry goals.

Untracked graph snapshot JSONs in graph-snapshots remain from earlier visualize runs; I left them untouched.

Next steps:
1. Run `npm run live-docs:visualize` (or the Antigravity entrypoint) to observe the current UX before tackling LD-406–LD-408.
2. Author the Layer‑3 component doc for the visualization explorer once the refactor lands, keeping the roadmap link live.

Made changes.
