### User Input

Your assertions are unfortunately apparently empirically false. I don't see anything on any of the views right now. There's been a regression.

Here's what I really want you to do for the Circuit Board and Local Map view: **Actual DOMs**. It's okay if the force graph gets special treatment since it's 3D, but your test clicks **miss** their target more than they do not. You are unable to access the breath of the functionality of these two views because they are not exposing a formal DOM in the way we want. I need you to rethink your approach on those two views. And the Circuit Board view needs to be capable of having _a thing in a thing_ if it's true inheritance. That is: a visual card could contain a visual card. Don't get married to the circuit board aesthetic. I went over to Google Search AI Mode with Gemini 3 Pro (you) active and asked for assistance. Here is a screenshot of what I got back.

### User Input

It's okay if the force-graph disobeys the "Actual DOMs" rule. But I know that your tools will work best when we have DOMs, and I think that we genuinely have some cases where things containing things is broadly acceptable. Indeed, you could potentially rearrange which things contain which things based on directory versus inheritance structure.

The Implementation Plan file appears to have two implementation plans stacked atop one another. Am I mistaken?

It's a shame that the screenshots you take get saved to a directory that you do not, by default, have access to. Here are screenshots I have taken instead, with the browser console open so you can see the errors.

I have moved your walkthrough and all salient images to the chat history at @[AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/Antigravity/11-20/83f976da-d7f4-4c75-a16d-561dfbea1a4b] @[AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/2025/11/Antigravity/11-20/83f976da-d7f4-4c75-a16d-561dfbea1a4b] . Please inspect the walkthrough and verify that it looks as expected (it definitely definitely definitely does not). You now have access to the images that were once kept outside the workspace for embedding into the walkthrough.

These renders all show **extreme** shortcomings, none of which are acceptable, unfortunately. Please verbalize out loud, so that you may perceive it later when the images are not in your context window, what is wrong with each of these screens.

The force graph is back rendering, but for some reason we no longer color dots by archetype? Not a huge deal, just slightly odd. Not that we had a gorgeous color scheme on that to begin with. Would be nice to see that differentiation again if possible. Not the end of the world. What is bad is that the circuit board is still an unscrollable (go ahead, try) vertical mess with zero horizontal spacing, all supported by these rather DOM-unfriendly looking SVG elements. Why can we not render HTML cards again?

~~The local view has problems too. I cannot see any relationships for any file that I have selected. Each file is unitary and, of course, has text overflowing on its element as well.~~ Ope I'm wrong. Turns out I needed to widen out the window a bit. There are strange render artifacts shifting the nodes away from the edges in rather unintuitive ways. I'm going to place a strong bet that this is the result of your CSS animations. Let's, for now, cut out the idea of CSS animations and focus on getting a DOM and a set of screenshots that shows something without such obvious WCAG violations.  If your browser tooling allows you to listen in on the browser console, please do so. Can you send an F12 signal or anything? I'm genuinely shocked that my view is richer than yours (from my perspective).

### User Input

Closer! So, the force graph is only showing the color of the actively selected file, which is neat for finding it but unuseful for categorizing against everything else. If there's some kind of glow we can put on the active one, that's great, but otherwise we should stick to letting folks see nodes and edges colored by salient information that their eyes can learn and adjust to for concrete understanding. 

The circuit board view now is excessively horizontal, but didn't appear to have any per-node text overflows. That said, the area is totally unscrollable. I can't click and drag to pan, I can't scroll to view, it still feels very unresponsive _until_ I get surprised when my mouse hover causes one of those nodes to highlight! That part looks quite cool, but I notice that even heavy zooming can yield these odd jpeg-like artifacts. Where does that come from? Is there anything that can automatically output WCAG violations to you textually if you feel like the existing browser tooling is failing to sufficiently help you do your work? 

Finally, we really gotta run the linter on these edits if possible. Poor Github Copilot has been out fixing our slop all the live-long day. I saw the linter just called us out for having an "any" type? **Yikes**!
