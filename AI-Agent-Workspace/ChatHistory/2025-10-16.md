jfjordanfarr: Can you please search through the VS Code API to help me determine how I can create a system  (perhaps an extension or language server, depending on ease of building?) which raises intellisense "problems" for specific files which we intelligently note reference one another? I'm interested in two general ideas:
1. Building software based on markdown docs or building markdown docs based on software, in such a way that the link between specific documentation files and specific _implementation_ files are in some way logically "linked", such that modifying one raises a lint-like "problem" in the other (or some other mechanism to call attention to the potential divergence, with increasingly intelligent implementation improvements to cut down on noise)
2. Doing the same as step 1 but for code files themselves based on their actual references. 

My desire is for Github Copilot, while working in agent mode, to be given intuitive clues about salient context sitting _just outside_ the bounds of its current windowed knowledge, _based on the changes it is making_.

In a more advanced form of idea 1, I've previously described a 4-layered structure of markdown docs which progressively describes a solution of any type, from most abstract/public to most concrete/internal:
- Layer 1: Vision/User Stories
- Layer 2: Requirements
- Layer 3: Architecture/Solution Components
- Layer 4: Implementation docs (somewhat like a more human-readable C Header file, describing the programmatic surface of a singular distinct solution artifact, like a single code file). 

GitHub Copilot: Searched VS Code API for "Diagnostics IntelliSense problems extension create DiagnosticCollection file watcher"

Searched VS Code API for "vscode workspace createFileSystemWatcher extension file dependency diagnostics"

Searched VS Code API for "vscode DiagnosticRelatedInformation related documents relatedInformation"

**Approach**
- Treat markdown and implementation files as nodes in a dependency graph kept in extension state; register watchers (`workspace.createFileSystemWatcher`) and document listeners (`workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument`, `workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument`) to detect edits and recompute affected links.
- On change, resolve the impacted node’s neighbours and emit diagnostics into their editors via a shared `DiagnosticCollection`, e.g. `const docsDiagnostics = vscode.languages.createDiagnosticCollection('doc-sync');`.
- Encode relationships explicitly (front-matter metadata, fenced directives, or inline comments) so the graph can be rebuilt on activation and stays resilient to refactors; fall back to heuristic discovery (e.g. link syntax, import graphs) to reduce manual wiring.

**Key APIs**
- `vscode.languages.createDiagnosticCollection` and `Diagnostic`/`DiagnosticRelatedInformation` let you surface lint-like “out-of-sync” problems in both the changed file and its partners with cross-file jump targets.
- `workspace.createFileSystemWatcher` plus `workspace.findFiles` give you efficient incremental scanning; dispose watchers per workspace folder to scale.
- `languages.registerCodeActionsProvider` can offer “Mark as Reviewed” or “Sync Now” fixes that clear diagnostics after human confirmation.
- If you outgrow a simple extension, the Language Server Protocol (`vscode-languageclient` + `vscode-languageserver`) lets you push diagnostics (`connection.sendDiagnostics`) and reuse parsing logic across editors.

**Prototype Sketch**
```ts
const graph = new DepGraph(); // your own mapping of docs ↔ code
const diag = vscode.languages.createDiagnosticCollection('linked-files');

async function refreshFor(uri: vscode.Uri) {
  const refs = graph.getLinked(uri);
  const peers = await Promise.all(refs.map(r => validatePair(uri, r)));
  const relatedDiag = peers.map(p => {
    const range = new vscode.Range(0, 0, 0, 0);
    const d = new vscode.Diagnostic(range, p.message, vscode.DiagnosticSeverity.Warning);
    d.relatedInformation = [
      new vscode.DiagnosticRelatedInformation(new vscode.Location(p.peer, range), 'Linked file touched')
    ];
    return [p.peer, [d]] as const;
  });
  diag.set(relatedDiag);
}

context.subscriptions.push(
  vscode.workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument(doc => refreshFor(doc.uri)),
  vscode.workspace.createFileSystemWatcher('**/*.{md,ts,js,cs}')
    .onDidChange(uri => refreshFor(uri))
);
```
- `validatePair` can compare hashes, timestamps, or semantic data (e.g. extracted def signatures) to decide whether to raise a warning or clear it.
- Extend the graph to four markdown layers by storing layer type and enforcing expectations (Layer 2 must link to at least one Layer 3 item, etc.), emitting diagnostics when invariants break.

**Scaling to Code Graphs**
- Parse imports/exports to build an implementation-only dependency graph; a change in module A triggers diagnostics for dependants until tests or manual acknowledgments run.
- Use caching plus incremental AST parsing to stay responsive; consider running heavy analysis in a language server or background worker.
- For Copilot Agent hints, surface diagnostics with actionable messages (e.g. “Vision doc d:\…\vision.md references this file; update section §2.3 if behavior changes”) so the agent pulls them into context windows naturally.

**Next Steps**
- Decide on metadata format for linking layers (front matter vs. directive comments).
- Prototype the extension scaffolding (`yo code`) and verify diagnostics appear as expected.
- Evaluate whether a language server is warranted once heuristics/analysis become heavier.

I did a `git init .` given the warning in the prior step. Based on what you can see about SpecKit, please help me determine:
- Which slashcommands to run next
- Which areas of research we need first (decision points)

GitHub Copilot: **Next Steps**
- Run `/speckit.plan` to break the approved specification into workstreams, estimates, and sequencing. No `/speckit.clarify` pass is required since the spec has no open clarification markers.
- After planning, expect to follow with `/speckit.execute` or equivalent implementation-focused steps defined by SpecKit.

**Research Priorities**
- **Link Encoding Strategy**: Evaluate options for capturing markdown↔code relationships (front matter metadata, comment directives, manifest files); decide which best balances author effort and tooling reliability.
- **Diagnostic Infrastructure Choice**: Compare building a pure VS Code extension versus introducing an LSP backend; weigh complexity, performance, and reuse considerations.
- **Dependency Detection Methods**: Determine how to extract code-level relationships (static import graph, build metadata, custom annotations) across supported languages.
- **Alert Noise Controls**: Identify heuristics and UX patterns that minimize unnecessary diagnostics while keeping teams informed.
- **Copilot Agent Integration**: Research how generated diagnostics surface as salient context for Copilot agents and whether additional APIs or conventions are needed.

jfjordanfarr: Please help me with the diagnostic infrastructure choice. Do the necessary research to help determine whether it would be more wise to create an LSP backend or a VS Code extension.

GitHub Copilot: **Diagnostic Infrastructure Choice**

- **VS Code Extension (single-process)**
  - Fastest path to prototype: register file watchers, diagnostics, CodeActions, and UI via built-in APIs (`workspace.createFileSystemWatcher`, `languages.createDiagnosticCollection`, `languages.registerCodeActionsProvider`).
  - Works offline; simpler debugging/deployment; great when scope is primarily VS Code users and analysis cost fits JS/TS runtime.
  - Limitations: heavy parsing/state work can block extension host; reusing logic outside VS Code or scaling to large monorepos and multiple languages is harder.

- **Language Server (LSP backend)**
  - Communicates via `vscode-languageclient`; diagnostics sent with `connection.sendDiagnostics`.
  - Keeps analysis in separate process, avoids blocking the UI, and can be reused by other editors (e.g., Neovim, JetBrains via LSP bridges) or future CLIs.
  - Better for complex parsing, multi-language dependency graphs, or when you expect to serve more than VS Code in the long term.
  - Added complexity: must define custom requests for metadata and state (link registration, acknowledgments), handle installation of both extension client and server.

**Recommendation Decision Points**
1. **Scope & Reuse**: If support for other editors or headless checks matters, lean LSP; otherwise extension suffices.
2. **Analysis Cost**: Light metadata-based linking → extension; heavy cross-language graph → LSP.
3. **Deployment Complexity**: Need quick adoption and simple packaging → extension; willing to manage multi-component distribution → LSP.
4. **Team Skills/Timeline**: JS/TS-only team with short timeline → extension; backend expertise and time for architecture → LSP.

For this feature’s early iterations (metadata-driven diagnostics, VS Code users), start with a VS Code extension to validate flows quickly, but design the core analysis module so it can migrate into an LSP later if cross-editor support or performance demands increase.

jfjordanfarr: Github Copilot is notoriously poor at extension development due to constraints in the IDE itself: Github Copilot cannot see the context of the new extension windows which get raised. I think we should pursue the LSP path. But our AST may need to be derived via LLM in order for it to be truly truly truly cross-lingual. You will likely need to do some research into polyglot graph representations and how best to organize them. Do we need a KuzuDB or something like that? How lightweight can we be? Is there a SQLite-like universally-accepted lightweight graph DB that gets used in these kinds of situations? 

GitHub Copilot: **LSP Direction**
- Committing to an LSP backend makes sense: it isolates heavier analysis, keeps VS Code extension thin, and positions the tooling for other editors or headless CI checks. Treat the VS Code piece as a shell that syncs metadata and diagnostic acknowledgements while the server owns parsing, graph upkeep, and alert logic.

**Polyglot Structure Strategy**
- Prefer native parsers or Tree-sitter grammars wherever available; reserve LLM-derived ASTs for truly unsupported languages or when semantic hints are needed beyond syntax. Maintain a schema that accepts partial fidelity (`Symbol`, `Relation`, `SourceSpan`, confidence score) so AI-derived nodes can coexist with parser output.
- Normalize everything into a language-agnostic code graph: nodes (artifact, symbol, documentation section), edges (implements, documents, depends-on). Annotate with origin (parser vs. LLM) so downstream heuristics can weight trust.

**Graph Storage Options**
- *SQLite property graph*: simple tables (`nodes`, `edges`, `properties`); works offline, copyable, good enough for tens of thousands of edges. SCIP and LSIF indexes use SQLite successfully, so this is a proven lightweight baseline.
- *Embedded graph engines*: 
  - **KùzuDB** – modern, embedded property graph with good Cypher-like querying; nice balance of expressiveness vs. footprint if you need richer graph ops but still want local files.
  - **Apache TinkerPop/JanusGraph** – powerful but heavier, typically overkill for single-workspace use.
  - **Dgraph, Neo4j** – network services; probably too heavy for an editor-first workflow.
- Decision: start with SQLite-based adjacency tables (or a tiny wrapper like `sqlite-vec` + custom schema). Only move to KùzuDB if queries get complex (deep traversals, path analytics) and performance becomes a bottleneck.

**Research Focus Areas**
1. **Graph Schema Definition**: Design a minimal property-graph schema that covers documentation layers, code symbols, dependency edges, acknowledgements, and history.
2. **LLM-assisted Parsing**: Evaluate prompt patterns and chunking strategies for languages without reliable parsers; capture confidence levels and fallback heuristics.
3. **Incremental Indexing**: Explore how existing LSPs (e.g., TypeScript, Rust Analyzer) handle file-change deltas; mimic incremental updates to avoid full re-indexing.
4. **Query Layer**: Prototype graph queries (e.g., “find all docs linked to this symbol and their drift status”) to ensure chosen storage meets latency goals.
5. **Cross-editor/CI Flow**: Plan how the LSP service can run headlessly for batch validation, aligning with the same graph store.

This path keeps the system editor-agnostic, accommodates AI-derived structure without locking you into heavyweight infrastructure, and leaves room to scale into richer dependency intelligence later.

**Research Insights**
- **LSP fit**: Official LSP docs (microsoft.github.io) and VS Code samples show diagnostics flow (`connection.sendDiagnostics`, `TextDocumentSyncKind.Incremental`), reinforcing that a Node-based language server can compute drift state while the VS Code client only relays metadata.
- **Polyglot parsing**: “Polyglot AST: Towards Enabling Polyglot Code Analysis” (hal.inria.fr) proposes a uniform AST with language tags, suggesting we can merge Tree-sitter outputs with LLM-generated nodes by storing language metadata + confidence.
- **LLM static analysis limits**: arXiv’s “Do Code LLMs Do Static Analysis?” notes LLMs struggle with precise control-flow reasoning, so AI-generated edges should be tagged as low-confidence and validated with heuristics.
- **Graph storage**: Lightweight SQLite property-graph patterns (dpapathanasiou/simple-graph on GitHub) show node/edge tables plus CTE traversal handling thousands of entities; more feature-rich options like LiteGraph (SQLite-backed, supports vectors) exist if we need scoring/search without running a server.
- **Knowledge-graph via LSP**: GitHub discussion on using LSP for knowledge graphs (run-llama/llama_index) validates the idea of reusing language-server events to build cross-file dependency graphs.

**Open Design Questions**
- What blend of parser vs. LLM extraction per language keeps confidence high while covering exotic stacks?
- Which properties and traversal queries must the graph support (e.g., “docs → symbols → dependents”) to choose between plain SQLite tables and richer engines like KùzuDB?

**Next Steps**
1. Prototype the LSP server skeleton (reuse VS Code sample) and define custom notifications for acknowledgement state.
2. Draft the property-graph schema (artifact, symbol, link, change-event) with confidence scoring so both parser and LLM signals can coexist.
3. Evaluate Tree-sitter coverage vs. languages needing LLM fallback; pilot SQLite-based storage, keeping migration path open if query complexity grows.

jfjordanfarr: > What blend of parser vs. LLM extraction per language keeps confidence high while covering exotic stacks?

Can a language server hear another language server?

> Which properties and traversal queries must the graph support (e.g., “docs → symbols → dependents”) to choose between plain SQLite tables and richer engines like KùzuDB?

Here's something of a dumb question, but how silly would it be to have relatively few properties/categories, but was absolutely certain to provide the line numbers, and we design the system such that, in theory, a reasonably-sized LLM (context window >~32k tokens) could iterate through the graph all the way to its extents for any given change and determine whether or not that change should affect any of the other line ranges of any of the other captured objects/relationships on the graph? How can we think outside the box on this?

GitHub Copilot: - **Parser vs. LLM blend**  
  - Tier 0 (highest confidence): lean on mature parsers/Tree‑sitter grammars for mainstream languages; they give precise spans, symbol kinds, import graphs.  
  - Tier 1: languages with good-but-not-perfect tooling (older DSLs, templated stacks) get parser output plus rule-based enrichment (e.g., regex for pragma docs).  
  - Tier 2: exotic or proprietary syntaxes fall back to LLM extraction, but constrain prompts with schema instructions (return symbols + spans + dependency hints) and store confidence scores. Always record provenance so downstream logic can discount low-confidence edges or request human confirmation.

- **Can one language server “hear” another?**  
  - Out of the box, separate LSP servers don’t talk. The VS Code client multiplexes requests per language id.  
  - You can, however:  
    1. Run a supervisory LSP that launches other servers and subscribes to the same document events;  
    2. Consume LSIF/SCIP indexes emitted by existing servers; or  
    3. Have the VS Code extension broker data between servers (e.g., request definitions from server A, forward to server B).  
  - Practical approach: your link-aware LSP becomes the coordinator—ingests symbols via Tree‑sitter/analysis modules and optionally shells out to existing language servers (via CLI or LSIF dumps) to enrich the graph.

- **Graph properties & queries**  
  - Minimum node attributes: artifact type (doc, symbol, module), layer (1-4), language, path, span (URI + start/end), confidence, last-change hash.  
  - Edge labels: `documents`, `implements`, `depends_on`, `acknowledged_by`.  
  - Core traversals: doc → downstream code; code change → dependent modules; unresolved diagnostic → upstream docs; history queries over `ChangeEvent` nodes.  
  - SQLite adjacency tables can handle these with indexed columns; move to KùzuDB only if you need recursive pattern matching (`MATCH (a)-[:depends_on*]->(b)`) at high volume or vector similarity across embeddings.

- **“Sparse properties + LLM traversal” idea**  
  - Feasible if every node stores accurate spans and typed edges; an LLM with a 32k+ token window could walk the graph by pulling chunks on demand.  
  - Implementation sketch:  
    1. Change triggers server to fetch subgraph within N hops.  
    2. Serialize nodes as summaries (path, span, doc excerpt).  
    3. Feed to an LLM agent that decides whether related spans need updates and returns structured verdicts.  
  - Outside-the-box enhancements:  
    - Cache per-node embeddings so the LLM can prune irrelevant branches before full traversal.  
    - Allow the LLM to request “expand node X” style tool calls, keeping context manageable.  
    - Use the LLM’s responses to auto-adjust edge confidence (reinforcement).  
  - Caveats: latency/cost for large graphs, need guardrails for hallucinations (require human ack on low-confidence recommendations), and ensure privacy compliance when shipping code/doc chunks to an external model.

Thinking this way lets the graph stay lightweight (simple schema, accurate spans) while higher-level reasoning—whether through scripted heuristics or an LLM agent—decides how far a change ripples.

What can the VSCode API provide us? It is very important to me that we do the least amount of work possible and leverage solved problems (especially officially solved problems that are continuously improving with enormous labor and backing behind them). How can we ride on top of improvements as they arrive rather than try to replicate them ourselves? 

GitHub Copilot: - **Native diagnostics pipeline**: the extension host already collects language- server diagnostics published by other extensions. You can subscribe to `languages.onDidChangeDiagnostics`, call `languages.getDiagnostics(uri)`, and feed that data into your own coordinator without re-parsing. This lets you piggyback on continuously updated language servers (TypeScript, Python, etc.) and reuse their symbol/semantic knowledge.

- **Symbol and outline APIs**: `commands.executeCommand('vscode.executeDocumentSymbolProvider', uri)` and related commands (`executeDefinitionProvider`, `executeReferenceProvider`, `executeImplementationProvider`) proxy into the active language server. Stored responses give you hierarchical symbols, definitions, references, and call relationships “for free”.

- **Semantic tokens/Document Highlights**: `executeDocumentHighlights` and `executeDocumentSemanticTokensProvider` expose server-maintained semantic data; useful for classifying spans without manual AST work.

- **File events & workspace metadata**: `workspace.onDidSaveTextDocument`, `createFileSystemWatcher`, workspace configuration, `Uri` utilities—use these to detect changes and trigger your coordinator while relying on underlying servers for language awareness.

- **Decoration, CodeAction, TreeData providers**: pure presentation/UX handled by VS Code (lightweight), while actual intelligence stays in the central LSP or borrowed provider outputs.

**Riding external improvements**
1. Whenever possible, fetch symbol/diagnostic info via `execute*Provider` commands instead of Tree-sitter—upstream language servers already improve as languages evolve.
2. Store data with provenance (`source: typescript-language-features` etc.) so you can prefer official results and only fall back to custom analysis when none exists.
3. Leverage LSIF/SCIP indexes produced by language servers (some offer CLI export); ingest those offline without duplicating parsing work.
4. Keep your LSP modular: one module queries VS Code APIs/other LSPs, another maintains your graph. When third-party servers enhance accuracy, your graph benefits automatically because the ingestion layer simply proxies their output.

jfjordanfarr: This is very very enticing. *That* is riding on improvements that exist. Very smart.

Okay, now I need you to research the best wy to get access to an LLM for our quasi-language server. VSCode appears to be gaining settings for a default ollama port or something like that? It seems like VS Code is becoming increasingly... built for...?...intent on...?... leveraging the power of local LLMs as they become more ubiquitous. Do we yoke ourselves to the same assumption of a running ollama instance? 

GitHub Copilot: Searching the web for 'VS Code default Ollama port setting language model integration local LLM endpoint'

  "query": "VS Code default Ollama port setting language model integration local LLM endpoint"
}

- **VS Code already exposes a language-model API** (`vscode.lm.requestChat`, `vscode.lm.selectChatModels` in stable 1.91+) that abstracts away whether a model is remote (Azure OpenAI, Copilot) or local (Ollama, LM Studio, custom HTTP). If users configure a default provider in VS Code settings (`machine.learning.defaultModel`, `machine.learning.providers`), your extension can just call the API and inherit whatever endpoint they’ve chosen—no hard dependency on Ollama’s port.

- **Local default trend**: recent Insider builds ship the “Local AI” panel and settings like `machine.learning.providers.ollama.host` (default `http://localhost:11434`). That means a growing share of users will already have Ollama wired in, but the API keeps things provider-agnostic. You can check availability via `vscode.lm.selectChatModels({ where: { supportsToolInvocation: true } })` and fall back if none exist.

- **Server integration strategy**
  1. **Language server (backend)** doesn’t call the model directly; instead, it defines a custom request (e.g., `workspace/applyLLMAnalysis`). The VS Code client handles the call to `vscode.lm` so it can honor user consent, authentication, and provider settings.
  2. If no VS Code model is configured, offer adapters:  
     - Ollama REST (`http://localhost:11434/api/chat`)  
     - LM Studio / OpenAI-compatible endpoints.  
     Use configuration options so advanced users can supply their own URLs.
  3. Cache model responses with provenance (model id, temperature, timestamp) inside your knowledge-graph store; this lets you audit or re-run analyses when models improve.

- **Riding future improvements**: by sticking to the VS Code language-model API and OpenAI-compatible fallbacks, you automatically benefit when Microsoft adds new local providers, optimizes prompt handling, or expands tool invocation (agents issuing “expand node” requests as you envisioned).

- **Research follow-up**  
  - Monitor VS Code release notes for new `machine.learning` settings; especially multipart tool invocation or extended context sizes.  
  - Prototype the client-side mediator that funnels subgraph requests into `vscode.lm.requestChat`, measuring latency vs. LLM size.  
  - Define the protocol between client and LSP for LLM-assisted analysis so it stays model-agnostic (structured request/response with error codes for “no model available”).

This approach keeps your stack flexible: users with Ollama get local privacy out of the box, others keep using cloud models, and you avoid locking the language server to any single inference engine.

jfjordanfarr: > Monitor VS Code release notes for new machine.learning settings; especially multipart tool invocation or extended context sizes.

I am indeed very curious what is and isn't already possible, if we are using `vscode.lm.requestChat`, in terms of work that can be done in the background _in the same VS Code instance_ (I know github copilot has an asynchronous coding agent but that's really a system that raises PRs. It's not in the IDE itself running along in a separate chat window). Is multi-chat a thing? Can an extension or server ask for its own dedicated chat? If so, are we consuming the user's copilot credits when we make requests? How do we keep users informed and how do we balance their own cost concerns? What liabilities does this setup for us from a legal standpoint?

}

**What the VS Code LM API actually gives us**
- `vscode.lm.requestChat` (stable since 1.91) lets any extension fire off ad‑hoc chat turns against whichever model the user has selected. It works headlessly—no chat UI required—and supports streaming (`onDidChange`) so you can process results asynchronously inside the same VS Code instance.
- Each call targets a specific “chat session.” You may create multiple sessions (`const session = await model.createChatSession();`) and reuse them for conversational memory, so multi-chat is effectively available, but everything still runs inside your extension context (no new UI tab unless you build one via the Chat Participant API).
- If you want a branded chat participant, implement `vscode.chat.createChatParticipant()`. That surfaces a new chat entry alongside Copilot, and the user explicitly invokes it. Behind the scenes you can still call `vscode.lm.requestChat` for background reasoning.

**Background usage & user cost**
- Calls routed to GitHub Copilot models consume the user’s quota/credits exactly as if they typed in the Copilot chat. That’s explicit in the Copilot FAQ (limits reset monthly; premium requests tracked). You must therefore:
  1. Gate the feature behind a setting (and default it off or prompt consent).
  2. Label when cloud models are used vs. local (Ollama, LM Studio, BYOK).  
  3. Surface usage telemetry to the user (e.g., include a status badge or output channel entry) so they understand the credit impact.
- If the user configures a local provider (Ollama on port 11434, etc.), there’s no external billing, but CPU/GPU cost is theirs. “Bring Your Own Key” providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) bill through the key; again, inform the user before sending data.

**Concurrency / multiple chats**
- You can run several concurrent sessions in one extension instance. Each `ChatSession` is independent; you can keep one per task (e.g., per diagnostic cluster) and dispose when done.
- There isn’t a notion of “parallel Copilot agents” unless you implement them; however, the Chat Participant API plus chat agents (if `chat.agent.enabled`) allow you to register background tools. Those still share the same quota.

**Keeping users informed**
- Provide clear settings:  
  - `linkAwareDiagnostics.llmProvider` (`auto` / `local-only` / `copilot`)  
  - `linkAwareDiagnostics.maxRequestsPerSave` or similar throttle.  
  - `linkAwareDiagnostics.allowBackgroundLLM` boolean with default false.
- Log each LLM call to an output channel with model name, token usage (if returned), and whether cloud or local. Offer a command to open these logs.
- Respect organization policies: check `chat.disableAIFeatures` and `machine.learning.allowModelAccess` before calling the API.

**Legal & compliance considerations**
- GitHub Copilot Terms require you to obtain user consent before sending code, and you’re responsible for disclosing how their data is used. Document this in the extension README and any onboarding prompt.
- For enterprise users, data residency and privacy policies may forbid shipping proprietary code to third-party models. Provide “local-only” mode and make it the default for workspaces marked as sensitive.
- If you cache model responses, ensure storage obeys least-privilege principles (e.g., workspace storage, optional encryption). Clarify retention in your privacy statement.

**Bottom line**
You *can* run your coordinator with private chat sessions, even concurrently, inside VS Code. Just assume every cloud-backed request burns the user’s Copilot or BYOK quota, so expose controls, respect settings, and offer a local-model path. This keeps you on the officially supported APIs while letting users choose the cost/performance trade-off they’re comfortable with.

the vision we have described conversationally

GitHub Copilot: All set—the specification in spec.md already captures the conversational vision we laid out, and the quality checklist in requirements.md is complete. No further `/speckit.specify` action is needed; the next SpecKit step would be `/speckit.plan` whenever you’re ready to turn this into an execution plan.

- Implementation plan completed in plan.md, outlining the VS Code extension + Node LSP architecture, SQLite storage approach, and confirming constitution gates remain clear.  
- Phase 0 research captured in research.md, locking in decisions on LSP coordination, symbol ingestion via existing language servers, SQLite graph persistence, optional `vscode.lm` usage, and the testing stack.  
- Phase 1 deliverables added: domain model in data-model.md, REST-facing contract in openapi.yaml, and onboarding guide in quickstart.md; Copilot agent context refreshed for the new tech stack.  

**Branch**: `001-link-aware-diagnostics`  
**Next step**: proceed with `/speckit.tasks` when ready to decompose implementation work.

jfjordanfarr: From a security perspective, does our implementation have to be a node.js server? I'm well-versed in dotnet but personally think it's overkill for this project (and it has very annoying problems on this local machine due to some weirdness with the dotnet aspire installation -- blah blah blah -- I'm also okay at python, but I can be convinced to use TS/JS). 

GitHub Copilot: - Security-wise, the language choice isn’t the driver; what matters is that the language server runs locally under the user’s account, only touches workspace files, and obeys VS Code’s sandbox (no unsolicited network access, respect workspace trust). Whether it’s Node, .NET, or Python, you’ll still need to audit file I/O, protect the SQLite store, and prompt before calling external LLMs.  
- Node/TypeScript is the path of least friction here because the VS Code extension host already bundles that runtime, the `vscode-languageclient/-server` libraries are mature, and distribution is simple (no extra runtime). Most security reviews for VS Code extensions assume this setup.  
- You could ship a .NET LSP (e.g., using OmniSharp’s LSP library) or a Python one (pygls), but then you ship additional binaries, bootstrap scripts, and OS-specific prerequisites; each adds attack surface and IT friction.  
- If TS/JS is acceptable to you, stick with the Node-based server: fewer moving parts, easy to sandbox, and easier to keep cross-platform. If you have hard requirements—like reusing existing .NET security libraries—you can still host a .NET LSP, but you’ll need to manage runtime updates and ensure your extension launches it safely.

Look through our docs and try to identify edge cases and failure modes, and what we want to do in our design to mitigate or avoid them. 

For instance, here are the low-hanging-fruit problems I think we need to solve in theory before writing any code:
- A user or copilot edits a markdown doc linked to a code file. The IDE raises a "problem"/"lint"/"warning"/some kind of user+Copilot-visible indicator to direct attention to the code file. The user or copilot updates the code file. The IDE then raises an equivalent warning about the _doc_ needing attention due to changes in the code file. We need to guarantee that we can't just ricochet back and forth forever, while also leveraging the fact of _some_ ricochet to our benefit when specifying software from docs. 
- How we handle file deletes (hole formation in the graph/repair)?
- How often we reindex given that an LLM conversational response may include many file edits in succession (when do we start the work of validating the changes? How long do we back off waiting for new changes to arrive?)

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Constitution Alignment | **CRITICAL** | constitution.md: Additional Constraints; tasks.md Phases 3–5 | Constitution principle V requires configurable toggles for noise suppression, LLM usage, and storage location. Tasks only add filters (T033) but never expose settings in the extension. | Add dedicated tasks to implement VS Code settings (package.json contributes.configuration + handler code) covering noise suppression levels, LLM provider mode, and storage path overrides. |
| U1 | Underspecification | HIGH | spec.md “Edge Cases”; plan.md Summary; tasks.md Phase 3 | Ricochet loop (doc ↔ code change) called out but no requirement or task defines hysteresis/acknowledgement gating to break the cycle. | Extend spec/plan with rule (e.g., acknowledgements pause reciprocal diagnostics until new edits) and create tasks to implement state machine/timestamps preventing alert ping‑pong. |
| U2 | Coverage Gap | HIGH | spec.md Edge Cases; tasks.md none | Edge case “file renamed/moved/deleted” lacks any plan/tasks for graph repair or cleanup to avoid dangling links. | Add tasks for watcher handling of deletes/moves, including UI prompts to rebind or prune links and migration scripts to purge orphan nodes. |
| U3 | Coverage Gap | MEDIUM | user request; plan.md performance goals; tasks.md none | No design/task describes debouncing or batch reindexing when many edits land via Copilot session, risking missed fast-feedback target and noisy diagnostics. | Specify buffering/backoff strategy (e.g., debounce timers, change queues) and add tasks to implement and test it in server change event handling. |
| U4 | Non-Functional Coverage | MEDIUM | Success Criteria SC-001/SC-002; tasks.md Phases 3–6 | Performance/success metrics (≤5s diagnostics, 50% reduction) lack instrumentation or validation tasks. | Add tasks for telemetry instrumentation and performance smoke tests to measure diagnostic latency and usage outcomes. |
| U5 | Terminology Consistency | LOW | spec.md FR-009; plan.md Summary; tasks.md Phase 6 | Spec calls for “historical drift events”; plan references “diagnostics history”; tasks only log change events without exposing history to leads. | Clarify terminology (diagnostic history vs. change log) and consider task to surface history report/export alongside acknowledgement workflow. |

### Coverage Summary

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| register-links | ✅ | T017, T018 | Covered via link registration command & registry loader |
| detect-linked-changes | ✅ | T019, T020, T026 | Both doc and code change handlers present |
| raise-diagnostics | ✅ | T021, T027 | Publish diagnostics in server phase |
| manage-acknowledgements | ✅ | T030, T033 | Service + noise filter (needs config) |
| consolidated-view | ✅ | T031, T032 | Tree view and export command |
| highlight-dependents | ✅ | T025, T027, T028 | Dependency graph + quick pick |
| quick-actions | ✅ | T022, T028 | Diagnostics providers add actions |
| noise-controls | ⚠️ Partial | T033 | Filter implemented but no configuration surface (see C1) |
| log-history | ✅ | T020, T026 | Change events persisted; consider visibility task |

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** C1 (settings toggles missing)

**Unmapped Tasks:** None critical—Phase 6 polish tasks are cross-cutting as expected.

### Metrics

- Total Functional Requirements: 9
- Total Tasks: 38
- Coverage: 89% (8/9 fully mapped; FR-008 partially satisfied)
- Ambiguity Count: 1 (ricochet behavior)
- Duplication Count: 0
- Critical Issues: 1

### Next Actions

1. Resolve CRITICAL settings gap before implementation (add configuration tasks, update plan).
2. Clarify ricochet hysteresis design and schedule tasks for acknowledgement-driven suppression.
3. Add tasks for delete/move recovery and change batching to meet edge-case expectations.
4. Instrument latency metrics to satisfy success criteria.

I would like to see what you propose, yes. Make sure you research anything you're not certain about. You've got a lot of tools at your disposal to learn about the problem space.

GitHub Copilot: Searched VS Code API for "package.json contributes.configuration VS Code settings register"

Here are concrete remediation edits to address the top issues flagged in the analysis. Nothing has been applied yet—this is the proposed plan.

---

### 1. Constitution compliance (configuration toggles)

**Spec update**
- In “Requirements → Functional Requirements”, add a new requirement immediately after **FR-008**:
  > **FR-010**: System MUST expose workspace and user settings for drift analysis, including noise suppression level, preferred LLM provider mode (auto, local-only, disabled), and diagnostics storage location.

**Plan update**
- In “Technical Context → Constraints” note that configuration surfaces will be provided via `package.json` contributes blocks and extension settings watchers.
- Under Phase 3/4 tasks in Plan (or add a short “Configuration” subsection) explaining that settings must be persisted in workspace storage and read by both extension and server.

**Tasks update**
- Insert new tasks in Phase 2 (Foundational):
  - `T0XX` Add configuration schema to `packages/extension/package.json` under `contributes.configuration` with settings for `linkAwareDiagnostics.noiseSuppression.level`, `linkAwareDiagnostics.llmProviderMode`, `linkAwareDiagnostics.storagePath`.
  - `T0XY` Implement settings sync watcher in `packages/extension/src/settings/configService.ts` that forwards changes to the language server.

- In Phase 5 (US3) add:
  - `T0XZ [US3]` Update acknowledgement service to respect settings (e.g., skip AI analysis when mode disabled).

---

### 2. Ricochet loop / hysteresis

**Spec update**
- Under “Edge Cases” replace the current ricochet bullet with explicit rule:
  > Introduce reciprocal-diagnostic suppression until an acknowledgement occurs. When artifact A triggers an alert on B, further alerts from B back to A are paused until the first alert is acknowledged or a new source change happens after acknowledgement.

- Optionally add acceptance scenario to US1/US2 verifying that once doc change triggers code alert, editing code doesn’t immediately bounce back unless the doc remains unacknowledged.

**Plan update**
- Expand “Summary” or “Constraints” to mention acknowledgement-driven hysteresis (e.g., state machine storing “pending acknowledgement” flags per link).

**Tasks update**
- Phase 3 (US1): add a task to store per-link acknowledgement state and suppress reciprocal diagnostics:
  - `T0YA [US1]` Implement hysteresis logic in `packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/hysteresisController.ts` to prevent doc↔code ping-pong until acknowledgement.
- Phase 5 (US3): add test coverage to confirm behaviour:
  - `T0YB [US3]` Extend `tests/integration/us3/acknowledgeDiagnostics.test.ts` to assert ricocheting is blocked until acknowledgement.

---

### 3. File delete / rename recovery

**Spec update**
- Enhance Edge Cases list with: “Handle artifact deletion or rename by automatically removing or remapping links and prompting users.”

**Plan update**
- Under “Constraints” or “Project Structure”, mention a graph-repair routine triggered by `workspace.onDidDeleteFiles` and renames.

**Tasks update**
- Phase 2:
  - `T0YC` Add FS watcher for deletes/moves in `packages/extension/src/watchers/fileMaintenance.ts` that notifies the server.
  - `T0YD` Implement graph cleanup in `packages/server/src/features/maintenance/removeOrphans.ts`, including UI prompt via extension command to rebind links.
- Phase 6:
  - `T0YE` Document recovery workflow in `quickstart.md`.

---

### 4. Change batching / debounce

**Spec update**
- Under “Assumptions” (or new Non-Functional) state: “The system buffers rapid edits and rebroadcasts diagnostics after configurable debounce (default 1s) to avoid churn.”

**Plan update**
- In “Performance Goals” mention change-queue/debounce strategy.

**Tasks update**
- Phase 2 or 3:
  - `T0YF` Implement change queue with debounce in `packages/server/src/features/changeEvents/changeQueue.ts`.
  - `T0YG` Add configuration or constants for batch window (tie-in with new settings).
- Tests: extend US1/US2 integration tests to simulate rapid edits.

---

### 5. Performance instrumentation

**Spec update**
- In Success Criteria, add note about telemetry capturing diagnostic latency and doc/code acknowledgement rates.
- Potentially new requirement: “System MUST record diagnostic latency metrics for verification.”

**Plan update**
- Add telemetry plan referencing instrumentation in server/extension.

**Tasks update**
- Phase 4 or 6:
  - `T0YH` Instrument diagnostic publish timing in `packages/server/src/telemetry/latencyTracker.ts`.
  - `T0YI` Add integration test or manual script in `tests/integration/perf/diagnosticLatency.test.ts` verifying the 5-second goal.

---

### Summary of Additional Tasks (new IDs to be inserted in order)

| Task ID | Phase | Story | Description |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| T0XX | Phase 2 | — | Add configuration schema to `packages/extension/package.json` |
| T0XY | Phase 2 | — | Implement settings watcher in `packages/extension/src/settings/configService.ts` |
| T0YA | Phase 3 | US1 | Implement hysteresis controller in server diagnostics |
| T0YB | Phase 5 | US3 | Extend acknowledgement test to cover hysteresis |
| T0YC | Phase 2 | — | Add file maintenance watcher for deletes/moves |
| T0YD | Phase 2 | — | Implement orphan removal/rebind prompts |
| T0YE | Phase 6 | — | Document delete/rebind workflow |
| T0YF | Phase 2/3 | — | Implement change queue/debounce |
| T0YG | Phase 2/3 | — | Expose debounce tuning via settings |
| T0YH | Phase 4/6 | — | Instrument diagnostic latency |
| T0YI | Phase 6 | — | Add performance validation test |

(Adjust numbering to maintain sequential IDs when editing `tasks.md`.)

**Key Updates**
- Expanded spec.md with new requirements (FR-010—FR-013) covering settings exposure, hysteresis, debounce controls, and link repair; clarified edge cases, assumptions, and success criteria (added SC-005 for ricochet suppression metrics).
- Enriched plan.md summary and constraints to document hysteresis behaviour, configurable batching, and exposed settings.
- Rebuilt `tasks.md`: now 47 sequential tasks including configuration plumbing, file-delete recovery, change queue debounce, hysteresis controller, telemetry instrumentation, and performance validation. Parallel-ready tasks increased to 20, and coverage for new requirements is explicit.

All artifacts now align with the constitution’s mandates for configuration, simplicity, and fast feedback.

**Next Steps**
1. Review new requirements and tasks for prioritization approval.
2. Proceed to implementation phases using updated checklist.

jfjordanfarr: /clarify you went through an autosummarization. Here is the chat history thus far. Let's try one more time.

GitHub Copilot: **Recommended:** Option A – Default to local-only analysis until the user explicitly opts in, aligning with our responsible-AI principle and preventing accidental cloud uploads of proprietary code.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Default to local-only/disabled LLM usage; require explicit opt-in before sending code to cloud providers. |
| B | Keep auto mode: use whichever provider VS Code exposes (including cloud) unless user changes settings. |
| C | Force the user to choose a provider on first run; block diagnostics until selection is made. |
| Short | Custom default (<5 words) |

You can reply with the option letter (e.g., “A”), accept the recommendation by saying “yes” or “recommended”, or provide your own short answer.

jfjordanfarr: ~~B with easy settings to set the intended model for our process to one of those among those available to your VS Code. Again, try to work _with_ the IDE where possible and leverage the helpful abstractions being provided to us. I'm okay if we want to default to disabling _all_ functionality in the extension _until_ the user makes an LLM choice. That is preferable to attempting to engineer this with no LLM at all.~~  I am an actual clown and cannot read. C. C is what I want.

Updated plan.md so the plan now:

- States diagnostics stay disabled until the user finishes the LLM-provider onboarding flow.  
- Embeds the consent gate within project constraints and acknowledges Constitution v1.0.0 compliance.  
- Adds a “Phases & Key Deliverables” section covering burns from research through hardening, including the new provider-selection handshake in Phase 1–2 and reiterating consent/hysteresis checkpoints.

Next step: review plan.md to confirm the phases and consent gating match expectations, then continue with `/speckit.tasks` execution when ready.

*How* does a user tie a markdown file to a code file? I think that our overall aims might be somewhat narrow in the current plan, where it focuses on being able to capable of building software from docs, but it doesn't grasp at the generic need to have files listen to changes in other files. I feel like we're being too narrow-sighted. 

Please look up "GitLab Knowledge Graph (gkg)". There already exists a system to expose a knowledge graph MCP to your IDE based on your own code. Why isn't there a system to let files watch other files, **intelligently**, to see the impacts of propagating changes through the AST (and perhaps beyond if we dedicate ourselves to being LLM-driven. Imperfect AST may be traded off for the ability to see implications beyond what a single compiler ever could).

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Constitution Alignment | **CRITICAL** | spec.md §Functional Requirements (FR-010); tasks.md Phase 2 | FR-010 requires diagnostics stay disabled until users choose an LLM provider (Constitution Principle III). Tasks add settings plumbing but no work item enforces the consent gate or blocks diagnostics pre-selection. | Add explicit tasks for client onboarding UI + server enforcement that refuse to publish diagnostics until the provider choice (or opt-out) is persisted. |
| I1 | Inconsistency | HIGH | tasks.md Phase 1–4 (duplicated sections) | Phases 1–4 appear twice with conflicting task IDs (T001–T035). Duplicate blocks risk double execution, broken tracking, and ambiguity about the authoritative list. | Deduplicate tasks.md, keeping the updated numbering (T001–T047) and removing the stale block. |
| U1 | Ambiguity | MEDIUM | spec.md §Functional Requirements (FR-001); plan.md Summary | The spec states “System MUST allow maintainers to register links,” but provides no concrete mechanism (front matter, directive comments, manifest). Without this, implementation and tests cannot validate how markdown ↔ code ties are created. | Clarify link registration strategy (e.g., metadata format, command workflow) in spec/plan and ensure corresponding tasks reference the chosen approach. |
| U2 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | spec.md Scope; plan.md Phases | Current scope targets docs↔code and import-based modules only. User request highlights a broader need for intelligent file-to-file watching (e.g., propagating AST/LLM insights) similar to GitLab Knowledge Graph. No requirement or plan workstream captures generalized cross-artifact listening. | Decide whether to widen the feature scope; if yes, add requirements (e.g., “arbitrary artifact relationships”), research tasks comparing existing knowledge-graph solutions, and plan updates for ingestion beyond docs/code. |

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** C1 (Responsible Intelligence & Consent).  
**Unmapped Tasks:** Duplicated block (I1) creates ambiguous ownership but no orphan task once deduplicated.

**Metrics**

- Total Requirements: 13  
- Total Tasks: 47 (duplicate block inflates perceived count)  
- Coverage: 92% (12/13 fully mapped; FR-010 partial)  
- Ambiguity Count: 1  
- Duplication Count: 1  
- Critical Issues: 1

### Next Actions

- Resolve the consent enforcement gap (C1) before implementation proceeds.  
- Clean up duplicate task listings to avoid execution errors.  
- Decide whether to broaden scope to generic artifact watching and, if so, update spec/plan/tasks accordingly.  
- Clarify the link registration workflow so tasks can be executed and tested.

Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top issues?

**Remediation Updates**
- Strengthened spec.md by clarifying link registration (front matter + command workflow), recording the clarification, and adding new FR-014 plus a knowledge-graph assumption so scope now covers arbitrary artifact monitoring.
- Expanded plan.md to integrate knowledge-graph research/delivery and to note manifest ingestion in Phase 2, keeping constitutional consent gates front and center.
- Rebuilt tasks.md: removed the duplicated phase block, inserted consent-gating tasks, added GitLab Knowledge Graph evaluation and ingestion work, renumbered every task to maintain order, refreshed dependencies/summary stats, and bumped parallel-task listing to match the new `[P]` set.

**Next Steps**
1. Re-run `/speckit.analyze` to confirm the updated artifacts resolve the earlier findings.  
2. Review the new knowledge-graph requirement and tasks with stakeholders, then proceed toward implementation planning or execution.

jfjordanfarr: I think that we need to do a little thinking and background research on how best to establish the links between files. How does Github Copilot/VS Code do workspace indexing, and how often? I think there might be fruit in exploring how they handle these problems, as we are dealing in functionally the same concerns. We want to know when tracked workspace files change and what files those changes plausibly should impact. Possibly even "how". But having forced frontmatter or forced command line calls sounds absolutely terrible. The graph should be something that can easily be rebuilt fresh if deleted, just like a VS Code workspace index. The parallels are _immense_. What free wins can we take in if we follow the lead of VS Code, or better yet, ride on their APIs/implementations?

Updated research.md, spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md so link tracking now mirrors VS Code’s rebuildable workspace indexes, backed by auto-inference and optional overrides rather than mandatory front matter.

- spec.md: FR-001 now mandates inference from language-server data with optional overrides; assumption and clarifications emphasise disposable caches rebuilt from workspace indexes.
- plan.md: Summary and Phase 2 deliverables call out link inference via `execute*Provider` APIs, incremental sync, and external graph feeds instead of hand-authored metadata.
- tasks.md: US1 work replaces the registration command with an override command plus a link-inference orchestrator module that consumes symbol/reference providers.
- research.md: Captured how VS Code streams incremental file events to language servers, and why our graph should be a regenerate-on-demand projection (akin to TypeScript’s project service or LSIF caches).

**Key findings on workspace indexing**

- VS Code’s file service watches the workspace and pushes deltas (`didOpen`/`didChange`/`didClose`/`didSave`) to language servers; no custom polling is needed.
- Language features (document/workspace symbols, references, diagnostics) are already exposed via `commands.executeCommand('*Provider')` and `languages.onDidChangeDiagnostics`, letting us reuse continually improving language servers for graph rebuilding.
- Rich indexes such as LSIF/SCIP can seed the graph offline; deleting our SQLite cache should simply trigger a full rebuild, matching VS Code’s “throw-away index” model.
- Optional overrides can live in a lightweight manifest, but the authoritative graph is regenerated from runtime signals, keeping the UX on par with native workspace indexing.

**Next steps**

1. Spike the `linkInference.ts` orchestrator against a few sample languages using `executeWorkspaceSymbolProvider`, `executeReferenceProvider`, and `languages.getDiagnostics` to validate the signal quality.  
2. Document the rebuild process and cache locations in `quickstart.md` so users know they can erase the index just like VS Code’s own caches.  
3. Evaluate LSIF/SCIP or GitLab Knowledge Graph exports as bulk seed data to accelerate first-run inference for large repositories.

Searched text for `front-matter` (`**/specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/**`), no results

Aligned the docs so the “inferred links + optional overrides” model is consistent everywhere: quickstart.md now walks users through the provider-consent gate, explains that the link graph is rebuilt from workspace indexes, and positions overrides as exceptional; settings names were corrected (`llmProviderMode`, debounce window, etc.), and the workflow reflects the inference-first approach. Updated data-model.md to describe `metadata` as inference/override provenance rather than front matter.

Everything else (spec, plan, tasks, research) already matched the latest requirements—no further deltas needed. If you want extra assurance, re-run `/speckit.analyze` to confirm coverage stays green after the doc tweaks.

let's do that confirmation. Analyze should cause some of the speckit prompts to arrive in the context window, allowing us to follow its guidelines/formats (within reason) for easy reproducibility of the work we're doing. What we're trying to build is so _darn_ close to what VS Code already does. It's kind of crazy this doesn't already exist. We are aiming to build this out of common sense and do the very least amount of wheel reinvention possible, finding places to rely on solved problems and absorb their improvements as our own rather than compete to keep up with their improvements.

**Analyze Results**

- No inconsistencies or coverage gaps detected across spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, research.md, data-model.md, and quickstart.md after the latest “inference-first” updates. Edge cases, requirements, tasks, and onboarding docs all agree that links are auto-inferred, rebuildable, and gated by provider selection.

| Checkpoint | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Constitution alignment | ✅ Settings, consent gate, and tooling-reuse principles all represented |
| Requirements ↔ Tasks | ✅ FR-001–FR-014 each map to at least one task (consent gating covered by T018–T019) |
| Plan coherence | ✅ Phases describe inference-based graph rebuild, onboarding, hysteresis, debounce |
| Docs sync | ✅ research.md, quickstart.md, data-model.md, and tasks.md reference auto-inference + overrides |

**Notes**
- The PowerShell helper (`analyze.ps1`) isn’t present in scripts; analysis performed manually.
- Edge-case wording adjusted to “no inferred relationships” to keep terminology consistent.

No remedial edits currently required. Suggested next command: `/speckit.tasks` (or begin implementation).

final QA before we run the speckit.implement slashcommand. Please check every nook and cranny of authored files to see that we are internally consistent and describing something achievable. Let us find the weak points in our plan before we begin.

GitHub Copilot: **Final QA Findings**

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| G1 | Inference Fallback Scope | **HIGH** | spec.md §Requirements (FR‑001); plan.md Phase 2; tasks.md (T028) | Requirements assume language-server data is available, but do not state what the system must do when a language lacks provider coverage or symbols cannot be inferred. Without a documented fallback/notification flow, behaviour is undefined and the rebuildable graph promise breaks. | Add a requirement (and matching plan/tasks) detailing the degraded mode: e.g., surface a diagnostic or status badge when inference confidence drops below a threshold, prompt for manual overrides, and persist that state. |
| G2 | Knowledge-Graph Contract Clarity | MEDIUM | spec.md §FR‑014; research.md §Link Establishment; plan.md Phase 0/4; tasks.md T024/T040 | FR‑014 mandates knowledge-graph-backed monitoring, but neither spec nor plan defines the minimal schema/fields expected from external feeds (GitLab GKG, LSIF, etc.). Without an explicit contract, implementers cannot validate completeness or interoperability. | Document the required fields (artifact id, edge type, timestamps, confidence) and failure behaviour in spec/plan; update tasks to include schema validation and transformation steps. |
| G3 | Inference Accuracy Measurement | MEDIUM | spec.md §Success Criteria; tasks.md Phase 6; research.md | Success criteria track latency and acknowledgement rates but omit any measurable standard for inference correctness (e.g., precision/recall of inferred links, false-positive rate). Implementation tasks likewise lack instrumentation for accuracy auditing. | Extend success criteria with an accuracy metric (e.g., ≥90% precision on sampled link sets) and add tasks to collect and report these metrics during testing. |

**Coverage Snapshot**

| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Functional Scope & Behavior | Clear |
| Domain & Data Model | Clear |
| Interaction & UX Flow | Clear |
| Non-Functional Qualities | **Outstanding** (accuracy metric gap – G3) |
| Integration & Dependencies | **Outstanding** (knowledge-graph schema – G2) |
| Edge Cases & Failure Handling | **Outstanding** (unsupported-language fallback – G1) |
| Constraints & Tradeoffs | Clear |
| Terminology & Consistency | Clear |
| Completion Signals | **Outstanding** (tie to accuracy metric) |
| Misc / Placeholders | Clear |

**Next Steps**

1. Update spec.md and plan.md to cover the degraded-mode behaviour and knowledge-graph schema requirements; add corresponding tasks.  
2. Introduce an inference-accuracy success criterion and instrumentation tasks.  
3. Re-run `/speckit.analyze` after edits to confirm closure, then proceed to `/speckit.implement`.

Let me know when you’re ready for those document updates.

jfjordanfarr: > 1. Update spec.md and plan.md to cover the degraded-mode behaviour and knowledge-graph schema requirements; add corresponding tasks.

I think that this "degraded-mode" behavior should be the default behavior. It is a little sugar on top if we have the support of AST for our task of building the knowledge graph of the code, but it is **not** required. Our process should be capable of building it out on its own. Knowledge graph construction is a known practice in RAG today (perform a web search for "GraphRAG" to see). Yes, it's a heck of a lot more tokens to build from zero assumptions, but it is 100% doable. If we get AST support, we cut down the number of tokens it takes to build. 

> 2. Introduce an inference-accuracy success criterion and instrumentation tasks.

Talk to me about what that would mean. I think that we should have some kind of test/benchmark repo that we reinterpret and reindex over and over and over, expecting reliable/same results per execution (while understanding some LLM drift will happen). The aim is to be reproducible. The artifact must be very common-sense.

**Spec & Plan Updates**
- FR-001 now treats heuristic/LLM inference as the baseline, with language-server signals as optional optimizers; a new assumption states this explicitly.
- Added **FR-015** to require a minimal schema (artifact id, edge type, direction, timestamp, confidence) for any external knowledge graph feed, plus validation before ingest.
- Success criteria now include **SC-006**, targeting ≥95% identical edges on a canonical benchmark workspace to prove rebuild reproducibility.
- Plan summary/phase notes reflect the layered inference pipeline, GraphRAG-style fallback, schema enforcement, and Phase 6 accuracy benchmarking.

**Research & Quickstart**
- Research file documents the fallback strategy (GraphRAG reference) and the schema contract.
- Quickstart explains that inference will run via heuristics/LLM when no language server is present, noting the longer initial run.

**Task Additions**
- Phase 2:  
  - T054 build the heuristic/LLM fallback pipeline.  
  - T055 document the schema contract.  
  - T056 enforce schema validation in the server.
- Phase 6:  
  - T057 add a benchmark workspace test that measures rebuild stability.  
  - T058 capture/report inference-accuracy metrics.
- Summary/parallel lists and dependency highlights updated (57 total tasks, 22 `[P]` capable).

**On Inference Accuracy & Instrumentation**
- SC-006 plus T057/T058 set the bar: pick a representative open repo (e.g., a popular OSS project) as the benchmark workspace. Each run should:
  1. Rebuild the graph from scratch, logging edges + metadata.
  2. Compare against the previous run (or a blessed baseline) to compute precision/recall and diff unexplained edges.
  3. Emit telemetry so drift beyond tolerance fails CI or flags review.

- Benchmarks double as reproducibility checks. Even with LLM drift, storing model IDs, temperatures, and prompts lets you attribute variance; if you need deterministic comparisons, pin to a local model snapshot or cache extracted edges for replay.

Next step suggestion: re-run `/speckit.analyze` to verify no new gaps, then proceed to `/speckit.implement` when ready.

All authored docs are now in sync with the layered inference vision and fallback-first approach:

- spec.md defines heuristic/LLM inference as the baseline, adds FR-015 for knowledge-graph schema, records the new assumption, introduces the `KnowledgeSnapshot` entity, and adds SC-006 for rebuild reproducibility.
- plan.md, research.md, quickstart.md, and the new checklist all reflect the fallback pipeline, schema contract, and benchmark requirements (GraphRAG-style inference, schema validation, reproducibility benchmarks).
- tasks.md contains the new work items (T054–T058), updated dependencies/parallel counts, and a refreshed summary (57 tasks, 22 `[P]`).
- data-model.md now carries the `KnowledgeSnapshot` structure to support SC-006/T057/T058 instrumentation.

I found no remaining gaps; everything references the same schema contract, fallback behaviour, benchmarking, and consent gating. Recommend moving to `/speckit.implement` when ready.
