jfjordanfarr: Hello! Today is 10/19/2025 in my local time. It is a new dev day, and therefore we should begin by summarizing the previous dev day into its own turn-by-turn conversation summary. This time there should be some git commits to correlate with the chat messages in the summary you generate. The idea is to make these summaries into places of centralized truth where you can see clearly and easily where files and architectural decisions came from. 

Here is the previous work day's conversation:
#file:2025-10-17.md:1-1641 

And here is the (currently empty) file we'd like to emit the summary to:
#file:2025-10-17.SUMMARIZED.md 

Finally, here is the summary for 10/16 which was generated on 10/17:
#file:2025-10-16.SUMMARIZED.md:1-176

Captured the 10/17 conversation as a 19-turn, line-referenced recap with commit correlations in 2025-10-17.SUMMARIZED.md. It mirrors the 10:1 format, ties each turn to the source log, and documents commits `3cf24be` and `3ab7556` plus the upcoming T033 priorities. No tests were needed. Next step: review the summary whenever you kick off the next thread so we can dive straight into hysteresis and diagnostic snapshot work.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Well done! You really followed my instructions well! That summary is impeccable! I added a thumbs-up to the message so hopefully that behavior gets gently massaged in with RLHF. Anyway, thanks for that! 

>  review the summary whenever you kick off the next thread

This is that next thread. Hello! :)

> plus the upcoming T033 priorities

Correct. It's time for us to implement. Pretend that I have fired off a `speckit.implement` slashcommand (if I actually explicitly do so, the strength of the internal prompt can sometimes overwhelm copilot's ability to know which work has already been completed, leading to reimplementations/repeat work): hydrate with salient spec docs and code as necessary to proceed to T033 confidently. Ask me if anything is unclear or underspecified. #file:001-link-aware-diagnostics

Summarized conversation history**Unit Tests**  
- Ran `npm run test:unit`; all 6 suites passed in ~0.6s, confirming hysteresis controller and diagnostics updates behave as expected.  
- Coverage still low for VS Code extension sources (0%) and some server utilities, matching previous state; no new gaps from latest work.

**Next Steps**  
1. Consider `npm run test:integration` to exercise the diagnostics flow end-to-end with hysteresis in place.

Ah, good timing. One thing I want to talk about:
Testing of our software: Why can we not use what we are building on the thing we are building? It's just typescript, no? We should be thinking about and prioritizing dogfooding this as early as possible, tuning it yourself to meet your own contextual needs.

Summarized conversation history

jfjordanfarr: > Diagnosing C++20 build failure
> Considering C++20 support for Node 22
> Evaluating better-sqlite3 upgrade and C++20 support

There's some history of trouble with this in the conversation summaries but I believe I got it working. I do have the VS 2022 C++ redist. That seems resolved? Albeit I'm still running node 22 instead of node 20 (never figured out how to downgrade on this machine; installer rejects downgrade). 

Anyhow, I see you just came out of an autosummarization so I'll flash the super concise version of the conversation history that "Copy All" gets us (this is the raw conversation format that I've been preserving; I hope that VS Code improves these "Copy All" pastes such that they include everything the user sees in the UI (thought step summarizations, changed files and by +/- how many lines, all that -- I even attached a screenshot so you can see the difference)). 

Please let me know if there is any user input expected during these integration tests. As I mentioned earlier, I saw that a UI came up providing me 3 choices from a dropdown. Presumably the onboarding is doing its thing. If user input is required on integration tests, we should also prioritize finding ways to run our software's pieces on our own codebase to verify its outputs, rather than launching a new VS Code window. (Again, that's only if the integration test approach we're using now is infeasible for the quirks of Github Copilot and agentic development; that remains to be confirmed).

 Wait wait wait, is it possible that we're getting this error because the VS Code host window disables other extensions? When I choose the top choice, "Enable diagnostics with local provider", am I inadvertently running into an error because Github Copilot has no enabled provider or something like that? What is the possibility that a quirk of VS Code extension host windows and their default safety mechanisms is behind the console output we're seeing? If I try clicking the "Reload and Enable Extensions", it just closes down and doesn't reopen, leaving this kind of pattern in the terminal:
 ```powershell

Once more I feel inclined to ask: is there not some other way by which we could test our software against our own workspace? Some way which does not require raising a different window in which you do not have access to the context? Your environment variable-based approach did not work on the VS Code Extension Host window, and if I click nothing at all, I get a terminal pattern that looks like this instead:
```powershell

I remember on 10/17 (check the conversation history) that you vehemently denied that we were making a VS Code extension. What do you think about that now?

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: I feel generally unresponded-to. 

GitHub Copilot: Appreciate the nudge—and the patience. I’ve been changing code but hadn’t paused to walk you through it; thanks for calling that out.

Here’s what changed since the autosummary:
- Added automation-friendly commands (`linkAwareDiagnostics.isServerReady`, `.clearAllDiagnostics`) and published them in package.json.
- Registered those commands during activation and set up a guarded `clear()` call in extension.ts.
- Updated the integration test (markdownDrift.test.ts) so it forces `LINK_AWARE_PROVIDER_MODE=local-only` before activating, hoping to bypass the onboarding quick pick.

Quality checks:
- `npm run lint` ✅
- `npm run test:integration` ❌ (still timing out in suite setup)

What we’re seeing:
- The extension host still raises the onboarding quick pick despite the env var, which blocks automation unless you click.
- Even after the click, VS Code reports `command 'linkAwareDiagnostics.isServerReady' not found`, so the registration isn’t visible inside the host.
- With no click, the suite hangs for the full minute waiting for readiness, since the command never resolves.

Why this likely happens:
- `runTests` launches VS Code with `--disable-extensions`, so only our extension should load; however the env var may not be propagating into the extension host (or we’re reading it too late).
- The command registration happens before `client.start()`, but if activation fails (e.g., provider selection awaiting QuickPick), those commands never get published—hence the “command not found”.
- So the root fix is eliminating that modal prompt entirely during integration runs, not relying on human input.

How I’d proceed next:
1. Capture whether `process.env.LINK_AWARE_PROVIDER_MODE` is defined inside `ensureProviderSelection` (temporary logging or telemetry) to confirm the hypothesis.
2. If env is missing, adjust the launcher to pass it via `runTests`’s `launchArgs` (e.g., `--force-user-env=`) or use a workspace config patch (`settings.json` in the fixture).
3. If env is present but QuickPick still opens, short-circuit onboarding earlier (before any UI call) and persist the global-state flag so repeated runs stay silent.
4. Once activation skips the UI, re-run to verify the readiness command is found and the tests proceed.

On “are we building a VS Code extension?”—yes. At this point the extension package, activation flow, and language client wiring are central to the architecture. Earlier hesitation is obsolete; we’re deep in extension territory.

Re testing on our own workspace: I agree the best experience is dogfooding in-place. Once the integration harness stops needing UI, we can wire a scripted “self test” that targets the current repo instead of the fixture. For now, let me unblock the automation path so no clicks are required.

Next steps I suggest:
1. Instrument `ensureProviderSelection` to log the detected provider mode and whether onboarding finishes without UI.
2. Re-run `npm run test:integration` to confirm the commands register and the suite advances.
3. If the readiness command is still missing, expose a lightweight status channel (e.g., `commands.getCommands(true)`) to debug from within the test.

I understand feeling unresponded-to—thanks for sticking with it. I’ll make sure to narrate progress as we iterate from here.

jfjordanfarr: Appreciated; it wasn't clear where the focus had gone. I have a better understanding now. I'll say that I just re-ran the integration test and it indeed still disables all other extensions and requires user input. Just as a sanity check, the behavior describing remains consistent. Indeed, after making the first selection in the UI, the same Host-closes-down-and-error-'linkAwareDiagnostics.isServerReady not found` behavior occurs. I have tried other AI-assisted development projects on VS Code extensions and none have succeeded so far due to the testing/verification barriers. We've bounced off similar problems more than once before and in more than one repo. I must strongly strongly encourage developing a way to test the components of our software here against our software, in our workspace. 

GitHub Copilot: **Where Focus Is**  
- The integration harness still blocks on the onboarding quick pick, so the readiness command never registers. I’ll change `ensureProviderSelection` to short-circuit when `context.extensionMode === vscode.ExtensionMode.Test`, set the workspace config (mode `local-only`, diagnostics enabled), persist the onboarding flag, and skip any UI. That keeps automation deterministic and should eliminate the “command not found” failures.  
- I’ll also double-check that command registration happens before any early returns so automation commands remain available even if diagnostics stay disabled.

**Dogfooding Agenda**  
- Once the test-mode bypass lands, we can reuse the same hook to add a “self-test” task that points the harness at the current repo instead of the sample fixture. No new UI, just the same flow against Copilot-Improvement-Experiments.  
- In parallel, I’ll surface a lightweight CLI harness for the language server so we can validate hysteresis/diagnostic behavior without spinning up VS Code at all—useful when we want fast, headless checks.

**Next Steps From Here**  
1. Patch providerGate.ts to auto-configure and mark onboarded when running in test mode (or when `LINK_AWARE_PROVIDER_MODE` is present).  
2. Ensure readiness/clear commands register before any potential early exit.  
3. Re-run `npm run test:integration` to confirm zero prompts and that the suite gets past `waitForLanguageServerReady`.  
4. If that succeeds, wire a second integration target that opens the current workspace, giving us a true dogfooding loop.

I’ll get the test-mode bypass up next and report back with the rerun results.

jfjordanfarr: Understood; you're clear to proceed. I'm up-to-date now.

jfjordanfarr: Interesting. This time we got this very repetitive behavior here in our terminal (the actual workspace). I selected the middle option to get this ("prompt me each time").

Changes in extension.ts now emit explicit test-mode overrides (force `enableDiagnostics: true`, `llmProviderMode: "local-only"`) when the extension is running under VS Code’s test host, and we log the effective configuration right after onboarding for traceability. The language server in main.ts consumes those overrides before the `ProviderGuard` runs and no longer advertises workspace diagnostics, eliminating the `workspace/diagnostic` request spam.

Tooling checks:
- `npm run lint` ✅
- `npm run test:integration` ❌ – still failing because no diagnostics ever land on `src/core.ts`.

What we’re seeing now is the server processing markdown saves but reporting `marked 1 document(s); 0 link(s)` before skipping publication, so the guard is no longer blocking us—the graph simply isn’t producing the expected drift edge. Next steps I’m planning:
1. Inspect the simple-workspace fixture and seed (or assert) the expected link so `publishDocDiagnostics` has a target.
2. Add lightweight instrumentation around the fallback inference / graph store writes to confirm whether the link inference path is running during the test.
3. Once diagnostics emit, re-run `npm run test:integration` to validate the full US1 suite.

Made changes.

jfjordanfarr: Understood; you are clear to proceed. Let's see if this becomes the first project in which we get a VS Code Extension actually working in the Host Extension window! :D XD

`npm: test:integration` task finished

Ran terminal command: npm run lint

- Added hysteresisController.ts plus its vitest coverage to keep reciprocal diagnostics from bouncing between linked artifacts until the window expires, including explicit acknowledge/reset hooks.
- Expanded workspaceIndexProvider.ts so integration runs seed implementation artifacts and emit `@link`-derived relationship hints with optional logging.
- Introduced TypeScript configs for the VS Code harness (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.json) so `npm run test:integration` compiles the runner before execution; the first run failed while the compiled suite was missing, subsequent runs succeed after the new build step.
- Captured the fixture graph snapshot in link-aware-diagnostics.db; please confirm we want this sqlite artifact checked in.

Tests: `npm run lint`, `npm run test:integration` (passes after rebuilding the integration bundle).

Next step: 1) Double-check whether the new SQLite snapshot should live in git or be regenerated during tests.

Made changes.

Well done! Let's prepare a git commit based on the progress we've made so far. I see that figuring this out is salient:

> Double-check whether the new SQLite snapshot should live in git or be regenerated during tests.

What would best practice be? I lean towards letting it be regenerated during tests?

Oh! Not super related, but I did get Gemma 3:27b enabled and running here over ollama! That thing is available with a **128k token context window** for our uses. We do not need to spend a dime on copilot requests during our tests (and hopefully, during the _typical_ functioning of our "definitely-not-an-extension" "definitely an extension"). 

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: git status -sb

Integrated the hysteresis controller (hysteresisController.ts) and its coverage to stop reciprocal drift alerts until the acknowledgement arrives, and widened the integration harness (workspace index provider, tsconfigs, VS Code runner) so the four US1 scenarios exercise the new suppression path headlessly.

- Key files to stage: hysteresisController.ts, hysteresisController.test.ts, workspaceIndexProvider.ts, updated integration runner sources under `tests/integration/**` (including the new tsconfig.json files) plus any spec/task ticks tied to this work. Several pre-existing edits are still in the tree (`git status -sb` lists them); please review and decide whether they belong in this commit before running:
  ```
  git add packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/hysteresisController.ts \
          packages/server/src/features/diagnostics/hysteresisController.test.ts \
          packages/server/src/features/knowledge/workspaceIndexProvider.ts \
          tests/integration/**/*.ts \
          specs/001-link-aware-diagnostics/tasks.md
  git commit -m "Add hysteresis suppression and regenerate integration harness"
  ```

- SQLite snapshot: best practice is to regenerate it during tests so we always validate migrations and avoid committing binary fixtures. I recommend deleting the current link-aware-diagnostics.db, adding .link-aware-diagnostics (or at least `*.db`) to .gitignore, and teaching the integration runner to `rm -rf` that folder before bootstrapping so each test run starts clean.

- Gemma 3 27B via Ollama with a 128k window is great news; once we surface the hysteresis flag through settings we can wire the inference layer to prefer that local provider instead of the hosted fallback, keeping Copilot API usage at zero during tests.

Next steps if you agree on the DB approach:
1. Purge the generated `.link-aware-diagnostics` directory and ignore it.
2. Re-run `npm run test:integration` to make sure the database is recreated automatically.
3. Stage and commit with the message above.

jfjordanfarr: Ah, okay, based on your next 3 steps segment at the end of your last response, I think it would make the most sense for us to commit "everything" (meaning, minus gitignored items) once we're satisfied with the shape of the bulk commit. Today's work so far _is_ the cumulative diff we're trying to save progress on _unless you think that it is pertinent to wait_. But the fact that we got our tests passing tells me we should move forward. 

I just added `*.db` to the gitignore and deleted the `tests\integration\fixtures\simple-workspace\.link-aware-diagnostics\` directory.

Added hysteresis suppression plus workspace indexing and refreshed integration harness, all green after regenerating the on-disk graph.

- Key additions: hysteresisController.ts (+tests) and the expanded `workspaceIndexProvider` to seed artifacts and `@link` hints for headless runs.
- Integration harness: tsconfig.json, tsconfig.json, and runner updates ensure we compile before invoking the VS Code host; the `.link-aware-diagnostics` snapshot is now ignored via `*.db` in .gitignore.
- Docs & logs: SpecKit progress (tasks.md) updated; chat history captured in 2025-10-19.md plus a summarized 10/17 recap.

Tests run: `npm run lint`, `npm run test:integration` (multiple passes, final run covers all four US1 checks after rebuilding bundles).

Next steps:
1. Stage all tracked changes (including .gitignore, updated package manifests, and workspace history as desired) with `git add ...`.
2. Commit once the diff looks right, e.g. `git commit -m "Add hysteresis controller and stabilize integration harness"`.
3. Keep the regenerated `.link-aware-diagnostics.db` out of git; the ignore rule covers reruns.

**Status**

- US1 scope is locked in, hysteresis committed, integration suite green. Spec/tasks now point squarely at the Phase 4 (US2) backlog.

**Recommendations**

1. Draft T034 (`tests/integration/us2/codeImpact.test.ts`) that walks both US2 acceptance scenarios: saving a code file should light up linked docs plus at least one dependent module. Reuse the simple-workspace fixture, but add a minimal dependency chain (e.g., core.ts → `feature.ts` → `util.ts`) so the test enforces FR-006.  
2. While spearheading T034, evolve the fixture data to register code↔doc links bidirectionally (via overrides or inference hints) so the test stays deterministic without hand-editing the SQLite store.  
3. Once the test captures intent, implement T035–T038 in order: symbol ingestion bridge on the client, dependency graph extraction and persistence on the server, then diagnostics publication for dependents. Keep the orchestrator incremental—reuse the workspace index provider when symbols are available and fall back to heuristics otherwise.  
4. After each subsystem lands, re-run `npm run test:integration` (US1 + new US2 spec) to confirm coverage, and tick the corresponding rows in tasks.md.

jfjordanfarr: Well, okay, so here's why I wanted to visit this again. I think we're juuuuust a little in the weeds (which is not all bad) about docs-to-code file linking. I think that problem is going to be quite difficult, and that we should work our way up to it. 

The function for our extension is this:
"""
For any given change in any given file, this extension provides the definitive answer to the question: "What files will be impacted by this change?"
"""

I think it would be much more wise for us to build up integration test cases of higher and higher complexity, some providing AST support and some without; gradually increasing in file count and cross-reference complexity. Once we are really really satisfied with our ability to detect the true set of perturbances for any given change _on code files_, _then_ we work our way up to code-to-docs and docs-to-docs. 

I think that our extension should start with a tree of the entire non-gitignored workspace (or heck, even the whole workspace) and essentially try to determine how each file talks to each other file. This is ultimately the artifact that we are seeking, and the artifact which, when queried properly, can definitively give us the ability to forecast the ripples brought about by any change in any file in the workspace. 

As our codebase solidifies, **our codebase should be one of those test codebases**. 

Examine our specs and see if anything should be updated to meet this overall vision.

Ran terminal command: git status -sb

Shifted the roadmap to match the “definitive change-impact answer” vision:

- Rewrote spec.md so US1 now targets code-to-code ripple analysis, with documentation alerts becoming US2 and requirements updated accordingly.
- Aligned plan.md to prioritise the workspace dependency graph first, then layer docs and lead workflows.
- Reorganised tasks.md: new US1 backlog (T034–T041) for code-impact work, existing documentation tasks now under US2, and summary counts updated.
- Moved the documentation drift integration test to markdownDrift.test.ts to reflect the new story order.

Next steps: seed the new US1 code-impact suite (T034) and build out the dependency graph pipeline, then rerun `npm run test:integration` once those pieces land.

Made changes.

Excellent. I thought those changes were well-made. I made a commit with that. We once more have a clean git slate. Please proceed to the next steps as you have described, but let me know if you need any guidance. Also: I have what is called "temporal context" enabled, which causes files which have been changed in this session to sit in the context window. If this is getting too crowded for you, I can disable the feature. It just means that, at each conversational turn, you must do a little bit more searching. Let me know if one is preferable over the other. In any case, please proceed.

jfjordanfarr: Do you need me to delete a file? I saw one of your thought summaries state that you were trying to delete a `markdownWatcher` file, but I never saw that delete go off. I wonder if there are quirks with attempted/attempting tool calls within the `<thinking></thinking>` block (or whatever reasoning delimiters are in place for the active model)? Hit me with the file path of what you want deleted and I can delete it.

I still need the legacy watcher removed at markdownWatcher.ts (and its companion test at markdownWatcher.test.ts). If you can delete those two sources, we’ll be fully switched over to the new `artifactWatcher`.

jfjordanfarr: Deleted; you're good to go

- Generalized the ingestion pipeline around artifactWatcher.ts, extending processing to both document and code artifacts while wiring the new watcher through main.ts, the persistence layer (saveDocumentChange.ts + test), and diagnostic publishing (publishDocDiagnostics.ts + test).  
- Replaced the legacy watcher test with `artifactWatcher.test.ts`, stubbing the `GraphStore` so unit tests no longer load the native `better-sqlite3` binding—this prevents the NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch you saw in the log.

- Tests now green: `npm run test:unit`, `npm run test:integration`.

Next up, it would help to document or script the `better-sqlite3` rebuild expectations so swapping between Electron (integration) and Node (unit) runs stays painless.

Extremely good point. I have updated my github copilot instructions twice, leading to a current version that reads:
````markdown
# Copilot Instructions

Last updated: 2025-10-19

## Workspace Shape
- npm workspaces: `packages/extension`, `packages/server`, `packages/shared`
- Supporting roots: `specs/`, `data/`, `tests/`, `.specify/`
- TypeScript 5.x targeting Node.js 20 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Projectwide documentation: `.mdmd/` (see note about 'MDMD' below)
- Specific feature/story documentation: `specs\[###-feature-name]\` (see note about 'Spec-Kit' below)
- **Copilot's (your) own scratch space/workspace during development:** `./AI-Agent-Workspace/`
    - **The entire development history, in summarized and unsummarized form, is located at `./AI-Agent-Workspace/ChatHistory/`.**

## Primary Tooling
- VS Code Extension API with `vscode-languageclient` / `vscode-languageserver`
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3`
- Optional LLM access through `vscode.lm`

## Commands
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run test:integration`

## Behavior Expectations

- **Total Code Ownership**: While the user is an experienced developer, their stated role is more in like with a product manager or architect. You, Github Copilot, are expected to take the role of lead developer. The sweeping majority of code is written by you, and you must be able to justify every code file's existence. If a file appears to be a vestigial LLM hallucination artifact, it is likely one of your own prior outputs, and should either be justified or removed. Assigning ownership of the code to Github Copilot incentivizes reducing the size of the codebase and avoiding unnecessary complexity, primarily as a means to reduce your own maintenance burden.
- **Complete Problem Solving**: Github Copilot has, in the past, been notorious for creating _workarounds_ when it encounters a problem. This is not acceptable behavior. You must be able to solve the problem completely, or else escalate to the user for help. Workarounds are only acceptable when they are explicitly requested by the user. 
- **Reproducibility, Falsifiability**: When designing tests and validations of the system that is being built, ensure that mechanisms are in place to preserve salient results of tests. There are cases where tests may cause contexts to be created which are unavailable to Github Copilot. In those cases, mechanisms like output logs should be in place to verify that the tests have passed or failed, and to what degree.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The technology underlying Github Copilot is necessarily unable to internalize lessons from a single VS Code workspace into the underlying language models' weights. No matter; by preserving the entire development history in chat log form and summarized form, we are able to continuously enrich your understanding of the codebase through every new thread. Combining this with careful use of `applyTo:`-glob-frontmattered `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` files, we can take preserve fine-grained lessons about the codebase, surfacing them only when salient. Beyond the chat history, there is an expectation to be progressively dogfooding the very enhancements being built in this workspace as its capabilities are developed. 

## Documentation Conventions

Our project aims to follow a 4-layered structure of markdown docs which progressively describes a solution of any type, from most abstract/public to most concrete/internal. 
- Layer 1: Vision/User Stories
- Layer 2: Requirements/Work Items/Roadmap
- Layer 3: Architecture/Solution Components
- Layer 4: Implementation docs (somewhat like a more human-readable C Header file, describing the programmatic surface of a singular distinct solution artifact, like a single code file). 

This progressive specification strategy goes by the name **Membrane Design MarkDown (MDMD)** and is sometimes denoted by a `.mdmd.md` file extension. In the longer-term, `.mdmd.md` files aspire to be an AST-supported format which can be formally linked to code artifacts, enabling traceability from vision to implementation. MDMD, as envisioned, aims to create a reproducible and bidirectional bridge between code and docs, enabling docs-to-code, code-to-docs, or hybrid implementation strategies. **For now, simply using the 4-layered documentation structure consistently is sufficient.**

Unlike the `.specs/` docs created by spec-kit-driven-development, the MDMD docs aim to preserve **permanent projectwide knowledge**. 

## Development Conventions

Our project utilizes Spec-Kit to plan, document, and implement specific feature-branch-sized stories (or greenfield new projects, like this one's first spec: `001-link-aware-diagnostics`). As the spec-kit ecosystem evolves, files in the `.specify/` folder may update from time to time. Visit here to see the kinds of prompts which power the `/speckit.{command}` slashcommands for reproducible agentic development. 

Documentation artifacts created as part of a `.specs/` folder do not necessarily need to be migrated to the `.mdmd/` permanent documentation structure, but the changes which result from a development story demarcated by a single `specs\[###-feature-name]\` folder should be migrated to the permanent documentation structure.
````

Our project does not yet have its MDMD documentation built out at all, but the folder structures have been created to support it. If you believe that the thing you want to document (the better-sqlite3 rebuild expectations) is a permanent fixture of our software -- something that can be definitively linked to a specific source code artifact (i.e. as a note in a markdown file for the specific test or suite of tests), we _can_ (cautiously) contribute our first MDMD file. That said, building out that crystalline documentation is going to be a beast and may be a spec-kit-driven story of its own. It would be a very good test of our change detection mechanisms, and would hopefully define the optimal scenario for our software to deal with (dogfooding on a best practices example of own project). 

If you think that the better-sqlite3 rebuild expectations are more pertinent to agentic development in this project itself (about the _process_ and not the software/solution _artifact_ itself), then you could instead contribute documentation to you `AI-Agent-Workspace`. The choice is yours.

`npm: test:unit` task finished

- Added a reusable script in package.json (`rebuild:better-sqlite3:node`) and wired `npm run test:unit` to call it up front so Node-side runs self-heal after the Electron harness rewrites the native binary.  
- Captured the ABI-swap workflow in better-sqlite3-rebuild.md, including manual commands for PowerShell and POSIX shells plus recovery steps if the rebuild fails.  
- Verified the new flow with `npm run test:unit`.

If you skip the npm wrapper and run `vitest` directly, just invoke `npm run rebuild:better-sqlite3:node` first to stay on the Node ABI.

Made changes.
